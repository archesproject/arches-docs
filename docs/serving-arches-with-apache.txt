When you are putting your Arches project in production, you'll need to serve it with a webserver. The following is a guide using Apache as an example, split into two sections:

+ :ref:`Setup Apache`

+ :ref:`Handling Static Files`

Setup Apache
============

During development, it's easiest to use the Django webserver to view your Arches installation. However, once you are ready to put the project into production, you'll have to use a more efficient webserver like Apache or nginx.

We have the most experience using Apache, which is very easy to install and configure. The following instructions work for Ubuntu 14.04, minor changes may be necessary for a different OS.

1. Get apache2 and mod_wsgi

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo apt-get install apache2
       $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi


2. Create the Python process
    
    In order to properly configure Apache, we must:

    + Create a python daemon process

    + Set the path to your project's wsgi.py file and reference to the python daemon process created above

    + Give Apache access to the main project directory

    All of these tasks are handled by adding a block of code to Apache's `../sites-enabled/000-default.conf` file. Use this command to open the file

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf


    and paste the following code into the ``<VirtualHost *:80>`` stanza, changing directory and file paths where necessary::


      WSGIDaemonProcess arches python-path=/home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project:/home/ubuntu/Projects/ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages
      WSGIScriptAlias / /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project/wsgi.py process-group=arches

      <Directory /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project>
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
         AllowOverride None
         Require all granted
      </Directory>

    Use `ctrl+x` to save the file.

    You may find it helpful to read the `Official Django Documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/#how-to-use-django-with-apache-and-mod-wsgi>`_ on serving Django apps with Apache and mod_wscgi.

3. Set file system permissions for Apache
    
    Now we must give Apache write-permission in a few locations. We'll do that by first changing the permissions of the necessary files and directories, and second by setting the Apache user as the group.

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo chmod 775 /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project
       $ sudo chgrp www-data /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project
       $ sudo chmod 664 /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project/arches.log
       $ sudo chgrp www-data /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project/arches.log
       
    .. note::
    
        On Ubuntu the Apache user is ``www-data`` (used in the example below), but on CentOS it is ``httpd``.

    These commands should give Apache sufficient permissions to create and modify the arches/uploadedfiles directory (where user uploads are stored by default) and the arches/tileserver directory where Tilestache caches tiles that it renders.

    .. note::
        Please post to the `Arches forum <https://groups.google.com/forum>`_ if you find that more permissions need to be modified, or that these directions can be simplified further.

4. Restart Apache.

    **Ubuntu**

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo service apache2 restart

    **CentOS**

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo /sbin/service httpd restart


    You should now be able to view your app from any web browser by navigating directly to your IP address (you don't need to run the Django dev server now).

    .. important::
        With Apache serving Arches, any changes to a ``.py`` file will not be reflected until you restart Apache:

If you are still in development and just want to use Apache instead of the Django server (and keep getting the lengthy Django error messages instead of a 500 page), you can stop here. Otherwise, you'll need to continue on to handle your app's static files.

Handling Static Files
=======================


There are two cases in which you need to follow these directions to handle static files (js, css, and images):

 * You are going to set ``DEBUG = False``, at which point Django will no longer serve them, or
 * You are leaving ``DEBUG = True`` but are developing and serving your project from a non-root location, say www.example.com/arches4 instead of www.example.com.

1. Create static files directory

    This directory can be placed anywhere. In the example below we are putting it inside of your project.

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ mkdir /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project/static


2. Configure your Arches project settings

    Now open your ``settings.py`` (or ``settings_local.py``) file, and add these lines to it.

    .. code-block:: bash

        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PACKAGE_ROOT, 'static')

        STATIC_URL = "/static/"

    This will point Django to your new static directory, and also tell it how to create a URL that points to that directory.

3. Collect the static files

    With your virtual environment activated, enter your project's top directory and run this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ python manage.py collectstatic

    Watch as all of your static files (including those that come standard with Django) are copied to the new directory. Now we are ready to tell Apache where to find them.
    
    .. important::

        With Apache serving your app you must run ``python manage.py collectstatic`` any time you make any changes to static files.

4. Configure Apache settings

    Use
    
    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

    to edit the default Apache configuration file. Find your ``<VirtualHost *:80>`` stanza with some familiar code in it. Below the original code you added, paste this block, changing paths as necessary.
    
    .. code-block:: bash

        Alias /static/ /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project/static/

        <Directory /home/ubuntu/Projects/my_project/my_project/static>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride None
            Require all granted
        </Directory>p


    The ``Alias`` line tells Apache where to look when Django sends it the ``/static/`` URL, and the subsequent block allows Apache access to your newly created static directory.

4. Restart Apache.

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo service apache2 restart
