Running and Configuring Arches
==============================

In this chapter you'll learn how to define important configuration
settings and define user accounts. You will have the ability to
customize Arches, but also the potential to alter the application in
profound ways. Make sure that you back-up all the default settings
before you commit your changes!


Running Arches
--------------

Starting Arches is easy: you just have to make sure that you run the
"runserver" command in the Arches root folder. Stopping Arches is also
easy: just press Control-C in the terminal window that you used to start
Arches.

By default, users can log onto Arches (from the host server) with the
following URL:

::

    http://localhost:8000/Arches/index.htm#

You may wish to configure your web server to support access for users
from client machines and the internet. This will require you to replace
the "localhost:8000" part of the URL with a domain or IP address.

Based on the resources (RAM, storage, CPU(s)) of the server that you've
installed Arches on, you may wish to tune how you allocate memory to
PostgreSQL (the underlying Arches database) and your web server (e.g.:
Apache or IIS). You can find guidance on these topics by visiting the
PostgreSQL, Microsoft, or Linux web sites.

Running Arches with Apache
--------------------------

If you plan on running Arches in a production setting then it is highly
recommended that you use Apache (or some other production quality
webserver).

.. warning::

   Do not use the in built django web server in production. See `the
   Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/>`__ for more information about using django with Apache

Step 1: Download and install Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows
^^^^^^^

Go to the `Apache web
site <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/platform/windows.html>`__, and
follow the instructions for downloading and installing Apache for
Windows.

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

From a terminal window type the following to install apache:

::

    sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install apache2

To confirm that Apache installed correctly, you should be able to go to
http://localhost in your browser and get the standard "**It Works!**\ "
page like:

::

    It works!
    This is the default web page for this server.
    The web server software is running but no content has been added, yet.

Step 2: Download and install mod_wsgi for Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows
^^^^^^^

Go to the `installation
instructions <https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/DownloadTheSoftware?tm=2>`__
page and download and install the mod_wsgi module for Windows Binaries.

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

From a terminal type the following to install mod_wsgi:

::

    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi  
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.load  

add the next string to the file

::

    LoadModule wsgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so  

save, then

::

    sudo a2enmod wsgi  
    sudo service apache2 restart  

Step 3: Edit your Apach httpd.conf file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows and Ubuntu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following lines to your httpd.conf (don't forget to replace the
dummy path names below to the ones corresponding to your setup)

::

    WSGIScriptAlias /<base_url_name>/path/to/arches_web/wsgi.py
    WSGIPythonPath /path/to/arches_web/archesproject/virtualenv/ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages

    <Directory /path/to/arches_web/>
    <Files wsgi.py>
    Order deny,allow
    Require all granted
    </Files>
    </Directory>

.. note::

  **General Notes**

  Using the example above, your site would be available from the following url: http://localhost/base_url_name/Arches
          
  Don't forget to restart apache after making these modifications

.. note::

  **Ubuntu Notes**

  Make sure that apache has (chmod 755) priveleges to all the
  directories down to the location where your Arches codebase resides

Step 4: Edit your settings.py file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your favorite editor, open the archesproject/settings.py file and
edit the following variables:

-  Point the STATIC_ROOT variable to the location in apache were static files are served.
-  Point the STATIC_URL variable to name of the folder you create to hold the static files (see below)

Windows
^^^^^^^

STATIC_ROOT = 'C:/Program Files/Apache Software
Foundation/Apache2.2/htdocs/media/' <-- make sure to create the media
directory if it doesn't already exist, also make sure the path is
correct
STATIC_URL = '/media/'

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

STATIC_ROOT = '/var/www/media/' <-- make sure to create the media
directory if it doesn't already exist
STATIC_URL = '/media/'

After doing this don't forget to run

::

    archesproject/build/build(.bat/.sh)

This will copy all the files in archesproject/arches/Media folder to the
directory you created above (in this example, called 'media')

You're Done! Go to http://localhost/base_url_name/Arches to browse the
Arches site.

Arches Configuration
--------------------

Arches is really two applications in one:

-  A map-based cultural heritage data management tool
-  A searchable online inventory of cultural heritage

Before you start using Arches, you'll probably need to update a few
configuration settings. Perhaps the most important of these settings
are:

-  Managing user accounts
-  Updating default map settings (mapConfig)
-  Managing basemaps and GIS layers
-  Managing resource layers

Arches implements `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`__, a
high-level Python Web framework that supports rapid and robust
application development. One of several nice features that Django offers
is a simple Administration Console.

Arches can be configured using the Django Administration Console. You
may access the console by typing:

::

    http://localhost:8000/admin

Be sure to replace "localhost:8000" with the domain name or IP address
of the server hosting your version of Arches.

Next, you'll need to log in. Arches comes with the following default
account:

::

        user: admin
        password: admin  
        

.. note::

  **Change the default "admin" password!**

  Its too easy for someone to
  guess this password! See the section on managing user accounts and
  change the default password for this account as soon as possible!

Once you've signed in to the Django Administration Console, you should
see a screen that looks something like this:

.. figure:: images/Django_Console.png
   :alt: Django's Site Administration Console

   Django's Site Administration Console

This interface will let you Manage users, define the state of the map
display in Arches, configure resources for display, and add GIS maps to
Arches.

Managing User Accounts
----------------------

Arches implements a simple user access model with the following 3 tiers
of users:

-  Guests
-  Editors
-  Administrators

Guests can access Arches and view information (either via the search
screens or through the Map screen) without having to sign on to the
system.

Editors require a user account to add, edit, or delete data.

Administrators may configure Arches and manage users.

Updating the Default Administrator Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arches automatically creates a single Administrator account with the
following credentials:

::

        user: admin
        password: admin  
        

You will definitely want to change the default password. To do so, log
in and click the "Change password" link at the upper right. You'll be
prompted to type in your current password ("admin" in this case), as
well as a new password.

Click the "Change my password" button when you're done (and be sure that
you don't forget your new password!).

Adding a New Editor Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Django Administration Console, simply click the "Add" button
next to "Users". You'll see a screen that looks something like this:

.. figure:: images/New_User.png
   :alt: New User Input Form

   New User Input Form

Add the Username and Password for the user account, then click the
"Save" button. Django will confirm that you are adding a unique user
name and valid password. If so, you'll see the following screen:

.. figure:: images/New_User_Detail.png
   :alt: New User Detais

   New User Detais

At this point, you can click the "Save" button at the bottom of the form
to create a user account with data-editing privileges.

.. note::

  **Optional User Information** 

  The "Change user" screen allows you to
  add additional information about the user, such as name and e-mail
  address. You may optionally also grant specific administrative
  permissions to this account in the "User permissions" section of the
  screen. Arches only requires a unique username and valid password to
  create an Editor account.

Feel free to explore the User adminstration functions available in the
Django Console. You'll see that it provides a suite of easy-to-use tools
for managing your Arches users.

One thing to note: the Django Administrator Console allows you to define
Groups. As of September 2013, Arches does not recognize Django Groups
for authentication.

Setting Default Map Settings
----------------------------

Now that you have Arches running, you'll probably want to configure
Arches for your particular geographic area of interest. You do this by
defining the map center point and initial zoom scale that you want
Arches to use.

From the main Django Administration Console, **Click App configs** and
then select **mapConfig** to access the configuration settings for the
map display in Arches display. You should see the following screen:

.. figure:: images/Django_Map_Config.png
   :alt: mapConfig

   mapConfig

Notice that this page lists the variable (Name: mapConfig), its
Defaultvalue, Datatype, and associated Notes. We're most interested in
the Defaultvalue:

::

    {
     maxExtent: new OpenLayers.Bounds(-200000, -200000, 200000, 200000),
     center: new OpenLayers.LonLat(-224149.03751366, 6978966.6705368),
     zoom: 6,
     numZoomLevels: 19,
     minZoomLevel: 1,
     fallThrough: false,
     controls: [new OpenLayers.Control.Navigation(), new OpenLayers.Control.Zoom()],
     displayProjection: new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:4326"),
     theme: null
    } 

In particular, notice that Defaultvalue includes a definition for the
map center ("center") and initial zoom level ("zoom").

This:

::

        center: new OpenLayers.LonLat(-224149.03751366, 6978966.6705368),
        zoom: 6,

tells Arches where to set the center of the map and the initial extent
to use for the map that you will use to create and display your cultural
heritage information.

The following coordinates set the map center point:

::

        -224149.03751366, 6978966.6705368

By default, Arches centers the map near Nottingham, England. The
-224149.03751366, 6978966.6705368 numbers are the coordinates for this
point in the `Spherical
Mercator <http://docs.openlayers.org/library/spherical_mercator.html>`__
projection.

To recenter the map, replace the default coordinates with the proper
coordinates for your preferred area. You can use this website
http://www.maptiler.org/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/
to determine the proper coordinates if you don't know them by heart.

.. note::

  **Pro Tip: Getting Coordinates from the Arches Map**

  If you're comfortable using the developer tools that come with Google Chrome,
  Firefox, or Safari, you can have Arches tell you the map center point.
  Simply navigate the map to your area of interest and type
  "arches.appPanel.mapPanel.map.getCenter().toShortString()" in the
  JavaScript console. Arches will return the center point of the current
  map.

  Once you've determined the center coordinates and map zoom level that
  you want to use, simply replace the default values with the coordinates
  and zoom level for your area of interest.

.. note::

  **Save a copy of the default values!**

  You may wish to copy and paste
  the Defaultvalue to a text file before making any changes to it. This
  way, you can be sure and recover to a working map if you run into
  problems updating the map center coordinates.

Click the save button when you are done. To update Arches with this new
information, navigate to the arches/build folder and run:

::

        build.bat (Windows) or ./build.sh (Linux)  
        

Refresh your browser (you may have to clear your cache) and navigate to
the Map screen in Arches to verify your new values.

Managing Basemaps and External GIS Layers
-----------------------------------------

Arches lets you define the basemaps and GIS layers (technically map
services) that your users will be able to work with.

Basemaps are the map(s) that your users will select to view the location
of resources. Google Streets, Bing Satellite, and OpenStreetMap are all
examples of commonly used basemaps for web applications.

GIS map services are maps that can be geo-referenced over a basemap,
allowing users to compare geographic information (such as zoning
districts or flood-prone areas) to both the basemap and resources.
Common examples include maps from data providers such as regional or
local govenerments.

In either case, Arches uses the OpenLayers library
(`http://openlayers.org <http://www.openlayers.org>`__) to manage the
display of basemaps and GIS map services.

Adding a new Basemap/GIS Service to Arches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the Arches Administrative console and select Maplayerss.

.. figure:: images/Add_Maplayers.png
   :alt: A listing of the resource map layers

   A listing of the resource map layers

Arches uses Google basemaps by default. But you can add additional
basemaps or replace the default maps if you wish.

Note that Arches includes a Map Layer for every resource (e.g.: the map
layers ending in E.xx), as well as GIS mapservices and basemaps (e.g.;
Precipitation, Google_Hybrid).

Really, the only technical difference between a basemap and a GIS
mapservice is that at least one basemap must be visible at all times.

Press the "Add maplayers" button in the upper right corner. You'll see a
data entry form that looks something like:

.. figure:: images/Add_Basemap_Form.png
   :alt: Add Maplayer Form

   Add Maplayer Form

**Step 1: Add Id**
  Each Arches map layer needs to have a unique identifier. Add a number
  that is not currently being used to identify your new External GIS
  Layer.

  Arches comes with several map layers by default, and map layer id's
  start at 1. In our example, Arches already has 18 map layers, so the
  next available number would be 20 (1 + 18 = 19 layers already
  sequentially indexed).

  If you're not sure what number to use, try a number like 1000. Don't
  worry, Django's administration console will tell you if you pick a
  number that already being used by Arches.

**Step 2: Identify as Basemap or GIS Mapservice Layer**
  Next decide if you want to create a basemap or a GIS map service. The
  Arches user interface lists basemaps in a separate grid, allowing users
  to toggle between maps.

  In contrast, GIS map services appear as "External Services" in the Map
  Layers grid. Users may display as many maps from the Map Layers grid as
  they wish.

  If you want to create a new basemap, click the "Basemap" check box.

**Step 3: Name your Layer**
  Type the name of your new map layer into the "Name i18n key" field.
  Pick a simple, friendly, and short name as Arches will use it in the
  list of map layers available for your users.

**Step 4: Define the icon for your layer**
  Type the name of the icon you want to associate with your new layer
  into the "Icon" field. Arches will look for your icon in:

  ::

      arches/Arches/Media/images/Asseticons
     
**Step 5: Define the Layer Group for your Layer**
  Arches organizes maps into groups. Basemaps are members of the
  "Basemaps" group. GIS mapservices are members of the
  "External_Services" group.

**Step 6: Define the Layer**
  Arches can display any layer type supported by OpenLayers version
  2.13. Luckily, this is a pretty long list. Check out the `OpenLayers
  API <http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.13.1/doc/apidocs/files/OpenLayers-js.html>`__
  (click on "Layer") to see the full list of 30 or so layers that can be
  added to Arches.

  For example, to add an esri map service to Arches, you could type:

  ::

      return new OpenLayers.Layer.XYZ("ESRI Topo", 
      "http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/tile/${z}/${y}/${x}",
        {
          sphericalMercator: true,
          isBaseLayer: false,
          zoomOffset: 1
        }
      );

  Arches passes this snippet of JavaScript to OpenLayers for rendering map
  services. The key elements here are:

  -  The name of the service: "ESRI Topo"
  -  Service URL:
     "http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/tile/${z}/${y}/${x}"
  -  sphericalMercator: true. This is a flag that tells OpenLayers to use
     the common webmapping projection
  -  isBaseLayer: false. Overrides the ESRI default.

  You may wish to consult the OpenLayers documentation for a more detailed
  summary of map service parameters.

**Step 7: Save**
  Press the "Save" button to complete the layer definition.

**Step 8: Register your Layer Name with Arches** 

  From the console home
  page, click on i18ns. Then click on the "Add i18n" button in the upper
  right part of the page.

  .. note::

    **What is i18n?**
    
    i18n is quick way to refer to "internationalization" (i +18 letters
    + n). Arches supports multiple languages for its user interface (UI),
    and uses i18n to keep track of each label (and its language)in the UI.

  Type in the name of your layer (entered in Step 3 above) into the "key"
  field. Enter the label you want the Arches UI to show for your layer in
  the "value" field.

  Next, enter the language identifier for your layer name in the
  "Languageid" field. Use

  ::

      en-us  

  for the version of English spoken in the United States. You can consult
  the web to determine the specific code if you want to use a language
  other than English.

  Finally, enter the following string:

  ::

      Arches.widgets.LayerLibrary  

  into the Widgetname field. This tells Arches where in the UI to place
  your label. Press the "save" button.

  You've just completed the steps necessary to add new basemaps or map
  layers to Arches. You should see a new entry in the i18n form that looks
  something like:

  .. figure:: images/Map_Layer_Completed.png
     :alt: New Map Layer Label

     New Map Layer Label

  You'll need to complete Steps 1 through Step 8 for each layer that you
  wish to add to Arches

**Step 9: Update Arches**
  Once you've completed entering your layer information, you'll need to
  re-build Arches. Go to the terminal window running Arches and press the
  Contol button and C button:

  ::

      control-C  

  To stop the Arches server. Navigate to:

  ::

      arches/build   

  and run the build script:

  ::

      build.bat (./build.sh in Linux)  

  This script will update Arches to include your new layers. Once the
  script completes (usually in just a minute or two), navigate to the
  Arches root folder and start Arches:

  ::

      runserver.bat (./runserver.sh in Linux)  

  Log back on to Arches (you may need to clear your browser's cache), and
  open the Basemaps Widget or the Map Layers widget to see your new maps.

Removing a GIS Map Service from Arches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing an existing basemap or GIS map service layer is simple. Just
open the maplayerss console, click the check box next to the map layers
that you want to remove, Select "delete selected maplayerss" from the
"action" dropdown, then press the "go" button.

Django will prompt you to confirm your selection. Click "Yes, I'm sure"
to delete the selected layers.

Cosmetic Settings
-----------------

Arches comes with some settings that are purely a matter of taste.
Things like the default image on the search page, and the colors we use
to symbolize resource geometries on a map.

You can easily update Arches to use images, colors, and geometry styles
that you find more attractive.

Changing the Image on the Arches Splash Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily replace the image of Stonehenge on Arches' screen screen
with something a bit more appropriate for your area. Open:

::

    arches/Arches/Media/css

in a text editor.

You'll find css classes for most of the UI components used by Arches.
You're free to replace Arches defaults with values for colors, fonts,
weights, and images with your own favorites.

Most of the class names should be reasonably self explanatory. For
example, find

::

    .quick-search-content 

this is the css class for Arches default page (e.g.: the "quick search"
page). Note the background-image value defines a jpeg image in the
/images sub-folder. Replace this value with an reference to the image
you want to use instead of Stonehenge.

You can follow similar steps to change the colors and fonts that Arches
uses by default. Once you've made your changes, go to the terminal
window running Arches and press:

::

    control-C  

To stop the Arches server. Navigate to:

::

    arches/build   

and run the build script:

::

    build.bat (./build.sh in Linux)  

This script will update Arches with your new css settings. Once the
script completes (usually in just a minute or two), navigate to the
Arches root folder and start Arches:

::

    runserver.bat (./runserver.sh in Linux)  

Log back on to Arches (you may need to clear your browser's cache) to
view your changes.

Changing the Style of a Resource Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arches allows you to define the map display for each resource. Although
Arches provides reasonable default settings, you can override the color,
transparency, line widths, and clustering display for any resource that
you wish.

From the main Django Administration Console, click on **Maplayerss**.
You'll see a screen similar to this:

.. figure:: images/Map_Layers.png
   :alt: A listing of the resource map layers

   A listing of the resource map layers

Click on a resource, such as ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (SITE).E27. You'll
see a summary of information about how this resource is displayed as a
map layer:

.. figure:: images/Map_Layer_Properties.png
   :alt: Some of the display properties for the Archaeological Heritage(Site).E27 resource

   Some of the display properties for the Archaeological Heritage(Site).E27 resource

Scroll down to the "Layer" variable. You'll see something that starts
out like:

::

    var clusterStrategy = new OpenLayers.Strategy.Cluster({distance: 100, threshold: 3});  
      var layer = new OpenLayers.Layer.Vector("ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (SITE).E27", {  
        rendererOptions: {zIndexing: true},  
        styleMap: new OpenLayers.StyleMap({  
            "default": new OpenLayers.Style({  
                 cursor: "pointer",  
                 strokeColor: "#2eb027",  
                 fillColor: "#2eb027",   
                 strokeOpacity: "${getStrokeOpacity}",  
                 fillOpacity: "${getFillOpacity}",  
                 pointRadius: "${getRadius}",  
                 strokeWidth: "${getStrokeWidth}",  
                 labelOutlineWidth: 1,  
                 fontColor: "#ffffff",  
                 fontOpacity: 1,  
                 fontSize: "12px",  
                 fontWeight:"bold",  
                 label: "${getLabel}"  
        },{  
      ...

OK, its a bit intimidating. But fear not, it will all make sense soon.
This is a bit of JavaScript that Arches uses to define how the layer for
each Resource Type is displayed on a map. It includes instructions on
how to cluster resources of the same type when viewing data at regional
scales, and it also tells Arches how to render each individual resource
when the map is zoomed in.

.. note::

  **OpenLayers Mapping Library**

  Arches uses the OpenLayers
  (`http://openlayers.org <http://www.openlayers.org>`__) library to
  manage the display of all mapping data. The JavaScript you see
  associated with each Resource Type is parsed by OpenLayers. Advanced
  System Administrators can reference the OpenLayers API and readily
  extend the default map display instructions.

Arches uses several techniques to display heritage resources on a map.
They are:

-  **Default Display:** These are the display parameters (colors, line
   weights, and fonts) that Arches uses to draw resources on the map.
-  **Temporary Display:** These are the display parameters Arches uses
   when you place your cursor over a resource. This lets Arches
   highlight a specific resource when you move your cursor over the map.
-  **Clusters:** Clusters are groupings of resources that are displayed
   at regional map scales (e.g: when you have the map zoomed out).

**Changing the Default Display for a Resource**
You can control how individual resources are drawn on the map by
updating this snippet of JavaScript:

::

        "default": new OpenLayers.Style({
           cursor: "pointer",
           strokeColor: "#2eb027",
           fillColor: "#2eb027", 
           strokeOpacity: "${getStrokeOpacity}",
           fillOpacity: "${getFillOpacity}",
           pointRadius: "${getRadius}",
           strokeWidth: "${getStrokeWidth}",
           labelOutlineWidth: 1,
           fontColor: "#ffffff",
           fontOpacity: 1,
           fontSize: "12px",
           fontWeight:"bold",
           label: "${getLabel}"
        },

Each line in this bit of JavaScript tells Arches how to draw the
geometry associated with an individual resource on a map.

For example, "strokeColor" defines the color used to draw lines (such as
for linear features and the outlines of polygonal features). "fillColor"
defines the color of the inside of polygons. "fillOpacity" and
"strokeOpacity" define the transparency of the geometries associated
with a resource.

So, you can change the color used to draw an ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE
(SITE).E27 line geometry (for example) from green to white simply by
replacing

::

       strokeColor: "#2eb027",
       

with:

::

       strokeColor: "#ffffff",

Notice that some of the drawing variables (such as "fillOpacity") have
values starting with a "$". These variables inherit values that Arches
sets for all resources. You're free to replace these values with your
own if you want a particular resource to have its own specific drawing
style.

When you've finished defining the drawing variables, click the "Save"
button to save your edits. To update Arches with this new information,
navigate to the arches/build folder and run:

::

        build.bat (Windows) or ./build.sh (Linux)  
        

Refresh your browser (you may have to clear your cache) and navigate to
the Map screen in Arches to verify your new values.

**Changing the Temporary (Highlight) Display for a Resource**
You can control how individual resources are highlighted on the map
when a user moves the cursor over the resource on the Arches map. It
works just like the default display, except that you update this snippet
of JavaScript:

::

        "temporary": new OpenLayers.Style({
           cursor: "pointer",
           strokeColor: "#2eb027",
           fillColor: "#2eb027", 
           strokeOpacity: "${getStrokeOpacity}",
           fillOpacity: "${getFillOpacity}",
           pointRadius: "${getRadius}",
           strokeWidth: "${getStrokeWidth}",
           labelOutlineWidth: 1,
           fontColor: "#ffffff",
           fontOpacity: 1,
           fontSize: "14px",
           fontWeight:"bold",
           label: "${getLabel}"
        },

When you've finished defining the drawing variables, click the "Save"
button to save your edits. To update Arches with this new information,
navigate to the arches/build folder and run:

::

        build.bat (Windows) or ./build.sh (Linux)  
        

Refresh your browser (you may have to clear your cache) and navigate to
the Map screen in Arches to verify your new values.

**Clusters**
If you're new to mapping, "clusters" may not be a familiar concept.
So, what are clusters? They are simply groups of geometries that
represent the location of resources.

You'll notice that at regional mapping scales, Arches automatically
clusters resource vectors. Why does Arches do this? Well, if your Arches
dataset is large, Arches would have to draw each individual geometry for
every resource. But at regional scales, with the map zoomed out, you
wouldn't even be able to see the details of most of these geometries.
Worse, your computer's browser would probably be overwhelmed by trying
to draw thousands of small vectors.

So, Arches clusters resources to ensure that you can work with very
large cultural heritage datasets.

Updating the way Arches renders clusters on the map is a bit of an
advanced concept. It's really a function of the OpenLayers JavaScript
library that Arches uses to map resources. Check out the `OpenLayers
API <http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.13.1/doc/apidocs/files/OpenLayers-js.html>`__
before you jump into this.

Limiting the Types of Resource to Load
--------------------------------------

Although most packages will provide a suite of Resource Type
definitions, you are not required to use them all. Before you can start
creating and managing cultural heritage data, you'll need to decide
which Resource Types you want to use and then load the corresponding
Resource Type definitions into Arches.

Select Resources to Load
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to and open:

::

    archesproject/settings.py

Scroll down until you find the "LIMIT_ENTITIES_TO_LOAD" parameter:

.. figure:: images/Resources_to_load.png
   :alt: Settings.py: Simple Search

   Settings.py: Simple Search

By default, Arches loads all the Resource Type definitions (hence the
"limit to load" is None). You can define the specific definitions to
load by providing a comma-delimited listing of just the resources you
want to manage:

::

    LIMIT_ENTITY_TYPES_TO_LOAD = ('ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (ARTIFACT).E18', 'LANDSCAPE HERITAGE.E27)

This would limit Arches to just loading the definitions for the
Archaeological Heritage element) and Landscape Heritage types (from the
CDS package in this case).
