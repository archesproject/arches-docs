What is Arches?
===============

Arches is an open-source geospatial software system for cultural
heritage inventory and management, developed jointly by the `Getty
Conservation Institute <http://www.getty.edu/conservation>`__ and `World
Monuments Fund <http://www.wmf.org>`__. Arches grew out of the
widespread need within the heritage field for the ability to create
electronic inventories at low cost that are easy to use and access.
Arches combines state-of-the-art software development with insights and
perspectives of heritage professionals from around the world.

The need for functional heritage inventories has grown over the last
decades, together with the rise of a global awareness of the importance
of heritage management. Nevertheless, inventories remain complicated to
establish and maintain, and frequently rely on costly proprietary
software that does not always fit the needs of the heritage field.
Arches provides a common platform that is easy to use and customize, and
yet one that takes advantage of the latest available technology to allow
users to create and manage heritage information in all its richness and
diversity.

The Arches System
-----------------

Arches is designed as a modular system, and consists of two primary
components:

**Arches Server.** The Arches Server is the core of the system and
provides essential services for managing cultural heritage information.
These services include implementing the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model
(CRM) ontology (`www.cidoc-crm.org <http://www.cidoc-crm.org>`__,
providing thesauri for managing culturual heritage concepts, and data
storage, indexing, and query services.

The Arches Server also provides common system administration services,
such as managing user accounts, assigning security roles and privileges,
and managing system configuration settings.

**Arches Data Management Packages.** Arches Data Management Packages
define cultural heritage data structures (modeled as graphs), User
Interface components (e.g.: data creation/editing forms, reports, and
map display), authority documents (e.g.: input files for the thesauri
services provided by Arches Server), and [optionally] data input files.

Arches Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Arches Server is a stand-alone software application. It is
responsible for providing the essential data management services needed
to create and maintain data inventories. For example, Arches Server
provides generic services to manage information graphs. These services
inlcude:

-  Core data storage services for arbitrary graph models
-  Core CIDOC CRM ontology classes and properties
-  Services to create, update, and retire data for instances of graphs
-  Services that index graph data
-  JSON services to publish graph instances
-  Generic query services
-  Thesaurus services to support creation of concepts (includeing
   associated labels and scope notes), as well as heirarchial and
   assoicative relationships between concepts
-  System administration and configuration interfaces

Consequently, Arches Server can be seen as a platform for hosting
specific representations of cultural heritage data, which we call Arches
Packages.

Arches Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arches Packages are self-contained modules that can be installed into
the Arches Server.

Arches Packages consist of code modules that:

-  Define the specific cultural heritage resources (defined using graph
   models)to be managed by Arches Server
-  Include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement client-side user
   interfaces (UI) including data creation/editing forms, data summary
   reports, and general UI for interacting with maps, defining query
   criteria, and navigating query results.
-  Data files to import concepts into Arches Server
-  Optional files to import pre-existing data records into Arches

Arches Packages are designed to support the creation of customized
cultural heritage records and data entry workflows. As such, Arches
Packages thought of as a suite of configuration files for Arches Server.

As of the release of Arches v2.0.0, the Arches development team has
created an Arches Package that implements the International Core Data
Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage. This is a
soon-to-be finalized standard for the inventory of both archaeological
and architectural heritage, which is based on the earlier Core Data
Index to Historic Buildings and Monuments of the Architectural Heritage
(adopted by the Council of Europe in 1992) and the Core Data Standard
for Archaeological Sites and Monuments (adopted by CIDOC in 1995).

This new core data standard (CDS) for archaeology and architecture was
used to create the first Arches Package (referred to herein as the "CDS
Package"). It identifies the data fields for many of the graph models
implemented in the CDS Package.

Key features
------------

**Purpose-built**. Arches has been purpose-built for the international
cultural heritage field, and can be used to inventory and document all
types of immovable heritage, including buildings and other structures,
cultural landscapes, heritage ensembles or districts, as well as
archaeological sites.

**Flexible**. The Arches Server/Package system architecture allows
organizations deploying Arches to custom the contents of existing
Packages or create their own customized Packages to meet their specific
cultural heritage data management requirements.

**Standards-based**. Arches incorporates internationally adopted
standards for heritage inventory, semantic modeling, and information
technology, leading to better practices in the creation and management
of heritage data and facilitating data exchange and longevity in spite
of advances in technology.

Applications
------------

Arches has been designed to serve a number of purposes fundamental to
the understanding, appreciation, and management of heritage places.
These include:

-  identification and inventory
-  research and analysis
-  monitoring and risk mapping
-  determining needs and priorities for investigation, research,
   conservation and management
-  planning for investigation, conservation, and management activities
-  raising awareness and promoting understanding among the public, as
   well as governmental authorities and decision makers
