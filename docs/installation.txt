Installing Arches
#################

Installation
============

Once you have all the dependencies taken care of (and Elasticsearch is running) you are ready to install Arches.

.. note:: If you are a developer hoping to contribute to the Arches project, please check out :ref:`Creating a Development Environment`.

1. Create and enter a new directory called Projects
---------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    mkdir Projects && cd Projects

2. Create a virtual environment called ENV
------------------------------------------
On some linux distributions, if the python version is less than 3.7, entering the following command may yield an error but it should alert you to any depdencies you may need to install, after which you'll be able to run this command.

.. code:: bash

    python -m venv /path/to/new/ENV

3. Activate the virtual environment
-----------------------------------

Note that when calling ``source`` to activate your ``ENV``, you'll likely need to type the relative path to it.

Linux and macOS::

    source ENV/bin/activate

Windows::

    ENV\Scripts\activate

When you activate your virtual environment, your command prompt will be prefixed with ``(ENV)``. If you need to deactivate it for any reason, run ``deactivate``.

4. Install Arches into your virtual environment
-----------------------------------------------

Use the following to get the latest stable release of Arches::

    pip install arches

5. Create a new Arches Project
------------------------------
Now that Arches is installed, you can make a Project. This is where you will make all of the customizations and branding that will make one installation of Arches different from the next. The name of your project should only be lowercase, and should use underscores instead of spaces or hyphens. The example below uses `my_project`. You can add ``--directory path/to/dir`` to change the directory your new project will be created in.

Linux and macOS::

    arches-project create my_project

Windows::

    python ENV\Scripts\arches-project create my_project

.. note:: At this level, "projects" are completely different from the mobile data collection "projects" that are mentioned elsewhere in this documentation.

6. Update settings_local.py
---------------------------

Before you continue, you may need to open ``my_project\my_project\settings_local.py`` and change some environment-specific settings.

* Depending on your Postgres/PostGIS installation, you may need to uncomment the DATABASES section and change the username and password, as well as the name of your PostGIS template database. If you will have multiple Arches projects using the same Postgres server, make sure to change the database name here as well.

* On Windows, you must specify the path to your GDAL library. Add the following line. Be sure to adjust the path as necessary for your GDAL installation, and note the *forward* slashes::

        GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = "C:/OSGeo4W64/bin/gdal201.dll"

* See Arches System Settings for a full rundown of how settings are handled in Arches.

7. Setup the database
---------------------

To begin working with your Project, first enter it::

    cd my_project

and then (with ElasticSearch running) run::

    python manage.py setup_db

.. note:: You may be prompted to enter a password for the ``postgres`` user, depending on your OS and how you installed Postgres/Postgis. Generally, our installation scripts set this password to ``postgis``.

8. Run the development server
-----------------------------

To confirm things are working, run::

    python manage.py runserver

and navigate to ``localhost:8000`` in a browser.

The default login credentials are 'admin' for both username and password. To change this password and create new users, navigate to ``localhost:8000/admin``.

Next steps...
-------------

Now that you have Arches installed and a Project created, you are ready to begin.

* Modify some :doc:`Initial Configuration </initial-configuration>` settings

* In order to allow API access to your instance, to support the use of the Arches Collector mobile app, you must :ref:`register an Arches application <Registering an OAuth Application>`.

* Read more about :doc:`Projects and Packages </projects-and-packages>`

* For a quick start that will create an example database schema in your new Arches project (and allow you to begin recording data right away), you can **load a sample package** with the following command

    .. code:: bash

        python manage.py packages -o load_package -s https://github.com/archesproject/arches-example-pkg/archive/master.zip -db true

    This example package has a full set of Resource Models, Branches, and Concepts that are generally based on the original :ref:`Arches HIP Contents`.

    .. note:: If you get an "invalid package source" error, please download the zipfile (use the url in the command) and run the same command pointing to the location of the downloaded zipfile.

General Troubleshooting
=======================

* On macOS, If you get this error

    .. error:: `ValueError: --enable-zlib requested but zlib not found, aborting.`

    try running ``xcode-select --install`` (`reference <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32909426/zlib-error-when-installing-pillow-on-mac>`_)

* Getting a connection error like this (in the dev server output or in the browser)

    .. error:: `ConnectionError: ConnectionError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x0000000005C6BC50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it) caused by: NewConnectionError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x0000000005C6BC50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it)`

    means Arches is not able to communicate with ElasticSearch. Most likely, ElasticSearch is just not running, so just start it up and reload the page. If you can confirm that it `is` running, make sure Arches is pointed to to correct port.

* Postgres password authentication error

    .. error:: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: pw authentification  failed for user postgres`

    Most likely you have not correctly set the database credentials in your ``settings.py`` file. Many of our install scripts set the db user to ``postgres`` and password to ``postgis``, so that's what Arches looks for by default. However, if you have changed these values (particularly if you are on Windows and had to enter a password during the Postgres/PostGIS installation process), the new values must be reflected in in ``settings.py`` or ``settings_local.py``.

    .. note::

        On Windows, you can avoid having to repeatedly enter the password while running commands in the console by setting the PGPASSWORD environment variable: ``set PGPASSWORD=<your password>``.
