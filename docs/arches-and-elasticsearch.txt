Installing and Running Elasticsearch
====================================

The quickest way to install Elasticsearch is to download and unzip one of the `compressed installers 
for the proper version <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-4-1>`_.

To start the service from the command line, use

.. code-block:: shell

   {path-to-elasticsearch}/bin/elasticsearch

To run as a daemon process, add ``-d`` to that command.

On Windows you can just double-click the ``{path-to-elasticsearch}\bin\elasticsearch.bat``
batch file to run the process in a new console.

.. note:: To run the process in a new terminal you can double-click the ``elasticsearch.bat`` file found in ``{path-to-elasticsearch}\bin``. To properly set up Elasticsearch as a background service on Windows, `check out this documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/windows.html>`_

---------------------------------------------------------

To make sure Elasticsearch is running correctly, use

.. code-block:: bash

    curl localhost:9200

You should get a JSON response that includes "You Know, For Search...". You can also use the Chrome plugin `ElasticSearch Head <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm?hl=en-US>`_ to view your instance in a browser at ``localhost:9200``.

For more information, please visit the official `Elasticsearch documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/running-elasticsearch.html>`_.

.. important::
   1. By default, Elasticsearch uses 2GB of memory (RAM). For basic development purposes, we have found it to run well enough on 1GB. Use ``ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g" ./bin/elasticsearch -d`` to set the memory allotment on startup (`read more <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html>`_). You can use the same command to give **more** memory to Elasticsearch in a production setting.


Reindexing The Database
=======================

You may need to reindex the entire database now and then. This can be helpful if a bulk load
failed halfway through, or if you need to point your database at a different Elasticsearch installation.
In the command line run::

    python manage.py es index_database

Be warned that this process can take a long time if you have a lot of resources in your database.
Also, if you are in ``DEBUG`` mode it can cause your server to run out of memory (see :ref:`reindex the database`).

If the ``es index_database`` operation doesn't solve your issue, you can try this series of commands::

    python manage.py es delete_indexes
    python manage.py es setup_indexes
    python manage.py es index_database


Using Multiple Nodes
====================

In production it's advisable to have multiple Elasticsearch instances working together as nodes of
a single cluster. To do this, you need to install a second Elasticsearch instance, and change the
``config/elasticsearch.yml`` file in each instance. Note that the cluster and node names can be whatever
you want, as long as the ``cluster.name`` is the same in both instances and the ``node.name`` is unique
to each one.

**Master (Original) Node Config**

.. code:: yaml

    http.port: 9200

    cluster.name: arches-app
    node.name: arches-app-node1

    node.master: true
    node.data: true

**Secondary Node Config**

.. code:: yaml

    http.port: 9201

    cluster.name: arches-app
    node.name: arches-app-node2

    node.master: false
    node.data: true

**Leave all other parameters untouched.**

You'll need to start/stop each of these instances individually, but you should always
have both running. When they are, the secondary node will automatically find the master
node and the indices will be replicated between the two.

Nothing about your project's ``settings.py`` should change; Arches need only connect
to the original Elasticsearch instance as before. However, you'll see now in the console output
that the cluster health will be ``[GREEN]`` when you have two nodes running (it's ``[YELLOW]`` 
if you only have one).

    and a `stack overflow question <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35717790/how-to-add-a-new-node-to-my-elasticsearch-cluster>`_
    with instructions for adding a node.


Adding a Custom Index
=====================

Arches allows you to create a custom index of resource data for your specific use case (for use in Kibana for example).

To add a new custom index create a new python module and add to it a class that inherits from **arches.app.search.base_index.BaseIndex** and implements the **prepare_index** and **get_documents_to_index** methods.

Example custom index:

.. code:: python

    from arches.app.search.base_index import BaseIndex

    class SampleIndex(BaseIndex):
        def prepare_index(self):
            self.index_metadata = {"mappings": {"_doc": {"properties": {"tile_count": {"type": "keyword"}, "graph_id": {"type": "keyword"}}}}}
            super(SampleIndex, self).prepare_index()

        def get_documents_to_index(self, resourceinstance, tiles):
            return ({"tile_count": len(tiles), "graph_id": resourceinstance.graph_id}, str(resourceinstance.resourceinstanceid))

add this to your settings_local.py file

.. code:: python

    ELASTICSEARCH_CUSTOM_INDEXES = [{
        'module': '{path to file with SampleIndex class}.SampleIndex',
        'name': 'my_new_custom_index' <-- follow ES index naming rules, use this name to register in Elasticsearch
    }]

Register your index in Elasticsearch: see :ref:`register a custom index`
