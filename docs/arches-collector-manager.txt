.. warning::

    Arches Collector has been deprecated and **does not** function with Arches v7.x and higher. For
    more information about the deprecation of Arches Collector and future plans for mobile-apps,
    please refer to <https://community.archesproject.org/t/arches-collector-update/1580>.


What Are Arches Collector Projects?
===================================

Using the :ref:`Arches Collector <Introduction to Arches Collector>` mobile app to crowdsource data
is dependent on the creation of Projects, by a database administrator, in the
Arches Collector Manager. Each Project is a discrete collection effort comprising the following:

+ Specific users or groups of users who are allowed to participate
+ Start and end dates to define when users are allowed to participate
+ A selection of which Resource Models will be used, and more precisely, which cards from within those Resource Models will be used
+ A set of existing resources from your database, to which users may add more data or just use as reference (based on card-level permissions)
+ An optional MBTiles file to provide a basemap for users working outside of wifi/cell network range

To facilitate a wide array of simultaneous data collection efforts, an administator can create
multiple projects, all targeting different users and a different type of data collection.

    To learn more about how data collection users will participate in Projects, please see :ref:`Arches Collector Workflow`.

.. important::
    Before you can use the Arches Collector app, you must make sure to complete the :doc:`Arches Collector Checklist </arches-collector-checklist>`

Arches Collector Manager Overview
=================================

.. important::
    To access the Arches Collector Manager, you must be in the Mobile Project Administrator group
    or have superuser status.

To get to the Arches Collector Manager, use the |acm-icon| icon in the left-hand nav bar, or
go directly to ``/collector_manager``. Before you have created any projects, the interface
will look like this:

As you begin to add more and more projects, the interface will resemble the Arches Designer,
with Projects taking the place of Resource Models:

Creating Projects in the Arches Collector Manager
=================================================

Use |new-project-btn| to begin creating a new project, and you'll be brought to the summary
page:

.. image::  images/start-new-project.jpg

Now, using the navigation tree in the left-hand panel, you will set all of your project parameters.
Detailed information about each parameter is available in the in-app help:

.. image:: images/open-help-project.gif

When you have filled out all the parameters, you will see in the project summary that all Project
Requirements have been met. You are now ready to activate the Project.

.. warning::
    Once a Project has been activated for the first time, its parameters are saved to an intermediate
    database, and they cannot be changed. Therefore, it's wise to double-check everything before the
    initial activation.

.. image:: images/activate-mobile-project.gif

Great! Now that you have activated your project, any data collection user that you assigned to it
will be able to download it through the Arches Collector app and begin collecting data.

----

After you have activated the project and data collectors have used it to add resources
to your database, the project summary page will tell your how long the project has been active,
how many resources have been collected, how many have connected to it, and more.

Creating an Offline Basemap
===========================

Projects allow for the inclusion of an `MBTiles <https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/mbtiles/>`_ file to serve as a basemap while data collectors are outide of wifi/cell network range. This file will be downloaded and stored on an Arches Collector users' device *the first time that "offline maps" are activated* in a project, not upon the initial download. Therefore, users should activate this map in the project before going into the field.

You can also obtain high quality and inexpensive tiles from sites such as https://openmaptiles.com. To create an MBTiles file with your own geospatial data, you can use a free account at `Mapbox.com <https://mapbox.com>`_, or desktop software like `TileMill <https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/>`_.

.. note::
    Large files will require longer downloads and more storage space on mobile devices.
