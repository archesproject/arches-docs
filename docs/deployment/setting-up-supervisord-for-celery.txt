Setting up Supervisord for Celery
#################################

Arches uses Celery (https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html), a Python framework for setting up and managing task queues. Using Celery,
Arches can delegate certain tasks with long execution times to separate processes. In a production deployment, this can enable Arches to delegate big jobs to a
queue so that requests to the Arches application do not lead to timeout or other errors.

This documentation discusses how to enable Celery task management using Supervisord (http://supervisord.org/). Essentially, Supervisord automatically monitors and controls Celery workers, checking to make sure they are operating, and restarting them if they fail.


When Do I Need Supervisord and Celery?
======================================
Arches *does not require* Supervisord and Celery to run in "production" mode (with ``DEBUG=False`` in `settings.py`). Arches instances managing smaller amounts of data may not need Supervisord and Celery. The deployment scenarios where you *should* consider using Supervisord and Celery include:

 * Supervisord and Celery will be required if you want to enable export / bulk download of more than 2000 resource instances.
 * Supervisord and Celery will be required to enable the Bulk Data Manager plugin to function. (Note: by default, Arches installs this plugin in hidden state.)



Supervisor and Celery Installation and Configuration
====================================================
The following is a guide **for a linux-based** OS; be advised you can change any of the file names, destinations, or permissions to suit your needs.


1. Supervisor can be installed using in your Arches virtual environment with ``pip``: ``pip install supervisor``.


2. In the core arches repo, in `arches/install/supervisor_celery_setup <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/tree/master/arches/install/supervisor_celery_setup>`_ there exist example files for supervisor, celeryd, and celerybeat. We recommend copying them into the following directory structure:

    .. code-block:: bash

        /etc/supervisor/
        |-- my_proj_name-supervisord.conf
        |-- conf.d/
        |    |-- my_proj_name-celeryd.conf
        |    |-- my_proj_name-celerybeat.conf


3. In the content of the files as well as the filenames themselves, replace the values of the following placeholders:

 * ``/absolute/path/to/virtualenv/`` - absolute path to your python3 virtualenv
 * ``[app]`` - replace this with the value of ``ELASTICSEARCH_PREFIX`` in your project’s ``settings.py`` file
 * ``/absolute/path/to/my_proj`` - absolute path to your arches project
 * ``my_proj_name`` - name of your project


4. Note that you can change the value for ``user`` in the ``-supervisord.conf`` file to a designated user to run supervisord.


5. Before proceeding, you will want to make sure that whichever user you designate to run supervisor has the appropriate permissions for the following files:

 * ``/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log``
 * ``/var/log/celery/worker.log``
 * ``/var/log/celery/beat.log``
 * ``/var/run/supervisord.pid``


6. Download and install RabbitMQ: https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html


7. Once successfully installed (and verified that it has been added to your PATH), start running it with the command ``rabbitmq-server``. For a convenient option, this can be run in a screen. Note that rabbitmq should be run prior to running supervisord. If you choose, you can use Redis as a "broker" instead of RabbitMQ (see below).


8. Run ``supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/my_proj_name-supervisord.conf`` to start the supervisord which will start celery workers for your tasks.


9. To check and stop your supervisord process, please review the following:

    a. To check on the status of celery (workers): ``supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisor/my_project-supervisor.conf status``
    b. To restart celery workers: ``supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisor/my_project-supervisor.conf restart celery``
    c. To stop celery workers: ``supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisor/my_project-supervisor.conf stop celery``
    d. To shut down supervisord (and the celery processes it controls): ``unlink /tmp/supervisor.sock``


Setting up Redis Instead of RabbitMQ
------------------------------------
Redis can serve as an alternative to RabbitMQ, but it lacks official Windows support. If you are not deploying Arches on Windows, you can use Redis as follows:

1. Follow the above directions (steps 1 to 5) for setting up supervisored, celery, and their configurations
2. Install Redis (see: https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)
3. Install the Python interface to Redis into your Arches virtual environment with ``pip``: ``pip install redis``
4. Configure the `CELERY_BROKER_URL` (in `settings.py` or overwritten in `settings_local.py`): ``CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://@localhost:6379/0"``
5. Activate Redis: ``redis-server``
6. Run ``supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/my_proj_name-supervisord.conf`` to start the supervisord and celery workers
7. Start Arches

Known Issue with Arches Celery Configurations and Celery Beat
-------------------------------------------------------------
The default configuration files in the `conf.d` directory discussed above need updating. Version 5 and later of celery has a revised order of arguments in using celery commands (see: https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/9202).

    * The corrected syntax (celery >= v5x) for the command at the top of `my_proj_name-celeryd.conf` looks like:
      ``/absolute/path/to/virtualenv/bin/celery -A my_proj_name.celery worker --loglevel=INFO``

    * The corrected syntax (celery >= v5x) for the command at the top of `my_proj_name-celerybeat.conf` looks like (all in one line):
      ``/absolute/path/to/virtualenv/bin/celery -A my_proj_name.celery beat``
      ``--schedule=/tmp/celerybeat-schedule --loglevel=INFO --pidfile=/tmp/celerybeat.pid``

After fixing the command syntax, the celery worker should function. However, you may still have trouble getting celery beat to work (https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/9243). Celery beat schedules periodic tasks (much like a `crontab` in a Linux operating system) using a Python implementation. In many cases, Arches will function without (evident) problems even if celery beat does not work. However, if you have workarounds or fixes, please let us know!
