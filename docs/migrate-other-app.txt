Full Workflow
#############

Experienced developers should be able to use some of these steps individually to accomplish discrete tasks, but we generally recommend following this workflow as a whole.

.. note:: All of the commands below must be run from within your v4 project.

1. Create a new package
-----------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py packages -o create_package -d pkg

The result should be a new package within your project named ``pkg``::

    my_project/
    └─ manage.py
    └─ my_project/
    └─ pkg/

Now go into your project's ``my_project/my_project/settings.py`` file and add this new line somewhere after the ``APP_ROOT`` line::

    PACKAGE_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(APP_ROOT),'pkg')

.. note:: You can actually name your new package whatever you want, and place it wherever you want, as long as ``PACKAGE_DIR`` holds the path to it. You can even leave out this setting entirely if you pass ``--target path/to/package`` to all of the ``v3`` commands below.

2. Prepare your package.
------------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py v3 start-migration

This will create some new directories and content in your package::
    
    pkg/
      └─ reference_data/
          └─ v3topconcept_lookup.json
      └─ v3data/
          └─ business_data/
          └─ graph_data/
          └─ reference_data/

3. Move your v3 data into the package.
--------------------------------------

Move ``v3fullexport.json``/``v3fullexport.relations`` from `v3 Preparation Step 1 <export-the-v3-business-data>`_ into ``v3data/business_data``.

Move ``v3reference_data.xml`` from `v3 Preparation Step 2 <export-the-v3-reference-data>`_ into ``v3data/reference_data``.

Move the ``_nodes.csv`` files from `v3 Preparation Step 3 <acquire-the-v3-resource-graph-nodes-csv-files>`_ into ``v3data/graph_data``.

Your package should now look like this::

    pkg/
      └─ v3data/
          └─ business_data/
              └─ v3fullexport.json
              └─ v3fullexport.relations
          └─ graph_data/
              └─ RESOURCE_GRAPH.Exx_nodes.csv
              └─ etc.
          └─ reference_data/
              └─ v3reference_data.xml
          └─ rm_configs.json

4. Convert your v3 reference data.
----------------------------------

Run:

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py v3 convert-v3-skos --import

New v4 reference data files will be created as shown below, and the ``--import`` flag will automatically load them into your database.

.. code-block:: shell

    pkg/
      └─ reference_data/
          └─ collections/
              └─ collections.xml
          └─ concepts/
              └─ thesaurus.xml
          └─ v3topconcept_lookup.json # already existed, but it's been updated

5. Build the v4 Resource Models.
--------------------------------

Now that the v3 reference data has been loaded, you are ready to create the v4 Resource Models. This migration process does not attempt to create them based on your old v3 graphs. There are a number of reasons for this, but most simply, v4 graphs have different constraints and support different datatypes and structures than those in v3. In other words, your v4 database will be better off with graphs that have been created natively, not translated from v3.

Generally, we would expect the v4 graphs to look like their v3 analogs, but we have built in quite a bit of wiggle room:

    * The graph names can differ
    * The node names can differ
    * The graph structure can differ

However, there must still be a one-to-one relationship between v3 and v4 graphs.

When it comes to node datatypes, the translation from v3 to v4 is pretty straight-forward.

.. table:: Datatype Translation -- v3 to v4
   :widths: auto

   ====================  ==================================
     v3 businesstable      v4 datatype
   ====================  ==================================
   ``strings``           ``string``
   ``dates``             ``date`` or ``edtf``
   ``geometries``        ``geojson-feature-collection``
   ``domains``           ``concept`` - if single value per v3 branch
   ``domains``           ``concept-list`` - if multiple values per v3 branch were allowed
   ====================  ==================================

.. important::

    When you set a v4 node to ``concept`` or ``concept-list``, you will need to select which collection to use. This is why it's best to have migrated and loaded your RDM scheme (step 4 above) before making the Resource Models.

    Refer to `Designing the Database <designing-the-database.html>`_ for help on this task. Within the Arches Designer itself, click |help-btn| for detailed help on each page.

----

Once you have built all of the Resource Models, **export them into your package**. You can do this one-by-one from the Arches Designer interface, or use::

    python manage.py packages -o export_graphs -d pkg/graphs/resource_models -g "all"

.. warning::

    If you have made any Branches, using the ``-g "all"`` argument will export them as well, which you don't want. You'll have to remove them from ``pkg/graph/resource_models`` and/or move them into ``pkg/graph/branches`` before moving on.
    
By the end of this step, you should have one JSON file per Resource Model in ``pkg/graphs/resource_models``.

6. Generate and populate the node lookup files.
-----------------------------------------------

Begin by running::

    python manage.py v3 generate-rm-configs

which will create ``v3data/rm_configs.json``. This file will be used to link the name of your v4 Resource Models with the names of their corresponding v3 graphs, as well as point to the files that link each node. Initially its content will look like::

    {
        "Activity": {
            "v3_entitytypeid": "<fill out manually>", 
            "v3_nodes_csv": "run 'python manage.py v3 generate-lookups", 
            "v3_v4_node_lookup": "run 'python manage.py v3 generate-lookups"
        }
    }

where ``"Activity"`` is the name of a v4 Resource Model. As the file says, you must now fill out the ``v3_entitytypeid`` value for all items. Typically, this will look something like ``"ACTIVITY.E7"``--upper-case with a CRM class appended to it.

Now, also as the file says, run::

    python manage.py v3 generate-lookups
    
and you'll see the rest of the values get filled out.

----

There will now be more CSV files in the ``v3data/graph_data`` directory. There is one per v3 graph, and they are used to match the names of v3 node names (column one), with v4 node names (column two). All of the v3 nodes will be listed for you, but **you have to fill out the v4 node names manually**, using your new Resource Models for reference. A portion of a filled out file could look like:

.. table:: ACTIVITY.E7_v4_lookup.csv
   :widths: auto

   ====================  ================
     v3_node              v4_node
   ====================  ================
   ACTIVITY_TYPE.E55     Activity Type
   ADDRESS_TYPE.E55      Address Type
   etc...                etc...
   ====================  ================

Finally, you can use::

    python manage.py v3 test-lookups

to check your work. Once this test passes, you can move on.

7. Write the v4 resource JSON.
------------------------------

Now you are ready to convert and import your v3 data::

    python manage.py v3 write-v4-json
    
This command will create new v4 resource JSON files in ``pkg/business_data``, one per Resource Model. You'll be provided with easy copy/paste commands to load the files if you want, or you can add ``-i/--import`` to the command to load the resources directly.

To help you debug any errors you encounter, and generally give you more control over this command, we've provided a number of optional arguments.

-i, --import
        Directly imports the resources after the JSON file is created.
-m, --resource-models
        List the names of resource models to process, by default all are used.
-n, --number
        Limits the number of resources to load.
--exclude
        List of resource ids (uuids) to exclude from the write process.
--verbose
        Enables verbose printing during the process. Not recommended for large operations.

To give an example:

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py v3 write-v4-json -m "Activity" -n 100 -i --exclude 08b68d46-c202-458a-bf11-bc7a1dd5b2ef

will write only the first 100 "Activity" resources to v4 JSON (even if there are more Resource Models in your package), excluding a single resource whose id is ``08b68d46-c202-458a-bf11-bc7a1dd5b2ef``, and will then immediately import these resources into your database.

.. tip::

    During this process, it may be useful to use::
    
        python manage.py resources -o remove_resources -y
        
    to erase all existing resources in your database and start from scratch.
    

8. Write the v4 resource relations file.
----------------------------------------

Once you have all of your resources loaded in your database, you can import the resource-to-resource relations from v3. Use::

    python manage.py v3 write-v4-relations
    
to write the file, and add ``-i/--import`` to directly import them. You will likely get errors if you try to import them but have not loaded all of your resources.

9. Load the entire package.
----------------------------------------

Though you may have been loading the individual pieces of the package along the way, the final step should be a full reload of the package. **The following command will erase your whole database and load it with the reference data, Resource Models, and resources you have just created.**

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py packages -o load_package -s "/full/path/to/my_project/pkg" --db true
