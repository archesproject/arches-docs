Localizing Arches
#################

If you want to support localization in your Arches instance, you'll first need to do the following:

1. Update your settings.py file by adding this import statement at the top:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

2. Next copy the MIDDLEWARE setting to your project's settings.py file.  If it's already in your settings.py file, be sure to uncomment ```"django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware"```

.. code-block:: python

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        # 'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
        "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        #'arches.app.utils.middleware.TokenMiddleware',
        "django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
        "arches.app.utils.middleware.ModifyAuthorizationHeader",
        "oauth2_provider.middleware.OAuth2TokenMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
        # "django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware",
        "arches.app.utils.middleware.SetAnonymousUser",
    ]

3. Next add the LANGUAGE_CODE, LANGUAGES, and SHOW_LANGUAGE_SWITCH to your project's settings.py file and update them to reflect your project's requirements:

.. code-block:: python

    # default language of the application
    # language code needs to be all lower case with the form:
    # {langcode}-{regioncode} eg: en, en-gb ....
    # a list of language codes can be found here http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html
    LANGUAGE_CODE = "en"
    # list of languages to display in the language switcher, 
    # if left empty or with a single entry then the switch won't be displayed
    # language codes need to be all lower case with the form:
    # {langcode}-{regioncode} eg: en, en-gb ....
    # a list of language codes can be found here http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html
    LANGUAGES = [
    ('de', _('German')),
    ('en', _('English')),
    ('en-gb', _('British English')),
    ('es', _('Spanish')),
    ]
    # override this to permenantly display/hide the language switcher
    SHOW_LANGUAGE_SWITCH = len(LANGUAGES) > 1

4. Now add this import statement to the top of your urls.py file:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
    
5. Finally add the following code to the end of your urls.py file:

.. code-block:: python

    if settings.SHOW_LANGUAGE_SWITCH is True:
        urlpatterns = i18n_patterns(*urlpatterns)

----

Once the system is prepared for localization, the next steps involve generating a Django message file or .po file which will contain all available translation strings in Arches and how they should be translated in any given language.

For more information, see `Localization: how to create language files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files>`_ in the Django documentation.

There are some example commands to make and load PO files in the core arches settings file that can be found `here <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.0.x/arches/settings.py#L193>`_. If loading a new PO file, simply replace the existing po file and run compilemessages.

**************************************
Localizing Graph Strings within Arches
**************************************

You can also export strings from your arches graphs for localization using the following arches-specific command

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py i18n makemessages

You can import them with the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py i18n loadmessages

This will attempt to load the graph translation files (graph.po files) for every language specified
in the LANGUAGES array from settings.py.

************************************************
Setting up Localized Languages for Business Data
************************************************

By default, every language from the LANGUAGES array in settings.py is available for business data entry.
To add additional languages for business data entry only, you can do the following. 

1.  Access the admin page (``http://localhost:8000/admin/``)
2.  Choose the "Languages" table.  (``http://localhost:8000/models/language``)
3.  Select "Add Language"
4.  Fill in information on new language, including a default direction.

Repeat this process for all new languages you wish to add. 

Additionally, remove any languages you do not plan on using.  

Once this is complete, text widgets should be able to write data in the desired languages.

***********************
RDF Imports and Exports
***********************

Business data can be exported in RDF format. The directionality of the string data will be lost as 
the RDF specification does not include directionality. There is an 
`active attempt <https://w3c.github.io/rdf-dir-literal/>`_ to include direction within the 
RDF specification.

***********************
CSV Exports and Imports
***********************

It is possible to import and export localized business data through CSV format. There is a ``--language``
switch that will limit the languages that will be exported (all languages are exported by default). 
However, if attempting to re-import a limited subset of languages through the csv importer, entire 
string objects will be overwritten by the subset. For example, if a string node has values for 
English, Spanish, and French, the subset of languages can be limited by specifying

.. code-block:: bash

    --languages en,es

If attempting to import the resulting csv, any values that were pre-existing for French would be 
overwritten in "overwrite" mode or added as a separate tile in "append" mode. There is currently
no way to merge these values. If the intention is to re-import the csv values later, export all
languages.
