Creating/Editing Resources
###########################

Creating a new resource in Arches-HIP begins with the RESOURCE MANAGER, and only requires that you enter one piece of information about that resource. Just choose which type of resource you want to create, and begin entering information.

To edit an existing resource, click the "EDIT" button which will send you to the RESOURCE MANAGER. The EDIT button can be found in three different places:

1. When a resource is listed in search results
2. At the top right corner of any resource report
3. In the pop-up summary that appears when you click a resource in the MAP VIEW

Using the RESOURCE MANAGER
==========================

The Resource Manager drop-down menu allows you to create records for new resources in your database. By default, only users with the appropriate credentials will be able to create and edit data in your installation of Arches. To log in, click on Log In on the top right of any screen and enter your username and password.

The input forms that you find in the Resource Manager are used both for new resource creation and the modification of existing resources. Each resource type uses a different collection of input forms, and each form collects a different set of information.  Therefore, a "resource" in Arches-HIP is really just an aggregation of attributes that are collected through the forms.

Arches-HIP supports the following resource types (these may have different labels in your organizationâ€™s installation of Arches):

* Historic Resource
* Historic District
* Activity
* Historic Event
* Person/Organization
* Information Object

Each resource type can be described by a set of attributes that are specific to that resource type. In Arches, and in the Heritage Inventory Package specifically, the set of attributes pertaining to each resource type is defined using a graph. To learn more about the graphs used in the Heritage Inventory Package, which are built using the CIDOC CRM ontology, you may refer to the corresponding section in the Arches-HIP Installation Guide.

In Arches-HIP, the resource types and their attributes are based primarily on the International Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage. This is a standard of the Documentation Committee (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museums. It is based on the earlier Core Data Index to Historic Buildings and Monuments of the Architectural Heritage (adopted by the Council of Europe in 1992) and the Core Data Standard for Archaeological Sites and Monuments (adopted by CIDOC in 1995).

The following section of this user guide will guide you through the process of creating records for the different resource types.
