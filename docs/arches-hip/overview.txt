What is Arches-HIP?
=========================
Arches-HIP, or "Heritage Inventory Package", is a custom package built on Arches v3, an inventory system designed specifically to record and maintain cultural heritage information. Arches-HIP was developed to work as a general structure for a wide variety of heritage information. From historic buildings to important people to significant events, it allows users to record, map, and relate a wide variety of heritage-related data.

Arches-HIP Website Structure
============================
Before learning how to use Arches-HIP as a user, this section will introduce you to the different interfaces that Arches-HIP presents to users. By default, Arches-HIP is set up to display the following screens for users to interact with:

* HOME
    Your Home screen will have been set up by your system administrator to display featured searches and other information relevant to your own installation.
    
* SEARCH
    You can enter a search term or get search term suggestions the database, as well as apply additional filters to create powerful queries.
    
* MAP VIEW
    Here you can view resources spatially on a map, and compare then to different base layers and overlays.
    
* RESOURCE MANAGER (for authenticated users)
    This is the data editing interface for Arches. Users with editing privileges are able to create new resources and edit existing ones.
    
* RDM (for authenticated users)
    The Reference Data Manager (or RDM) allows authorized users to work with the concepts that power your Arches-HIP database, including the terms that are used to describe them and the hierarchical relationships among them.

Beyond the Website
=====================
If you are a database administrator, you'll also need to access the Django admin panel, which is where you create new user accounts and manage permissions. If your account has "staff" privileges, go to www.yourwebsite.com/admin to login. For detailed information on how to work with Django's admin interface, please see this documentation.
