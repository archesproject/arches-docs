What is a Resource Type?
==========================

In Arches, database resources are categorized by resource typeEach resource type can be described by a set of attributes that are specific to that resource type. In Arches, and in the Heritage Inventory Package specifically, the set of attributes pertaining to each resource type is defined using a graph. To learn more about the graphs used in the Heritage Inventory Package, which are built using the CIDOC CRM ontology, you may refer to the corresponding section in the Arches-HIP Installation Guide.

In Arches-HIP, the resource types and their attributes are based primarily on the International Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage. This is a standard of the Documentation Committee (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museums. It is based on the earlier Core Data Index to Historic Buildings and Monuments of the Architectural Heritage (adopted by the Council of Europe in 1992) and the Core Data Standard for Archaeological Sites and Monuments (adopted by CIDOC in 1995).

By default, Arches-HIP supports the following types of resources (more information on each is below):

* `Historic Resource`_
* `Historic District`_
* `Activity`_
* `Historic Event`_
* `Person/Organization`_
* `Information Resource`_



The following section of this user guide will guide you through the process of creating records for the different resource types.
