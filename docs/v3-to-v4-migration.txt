############################
Migrating Data from v3 to v4
############################

.. sidebar:: Terminology Note

    In v3 we had "resource graphs", while in v4 we call these "Resource Models". Conceptually they are the same. We'll be referring to them here as "v3 graphs" and "v4 graphs"/"Resource Models", respectively.

Upgrading your Arches installation is a complex process, as a significant backend redesign was implemented in v4. We have developed the following documentation (and the code to support it) to guide you through the process. You will be performing a combination of shell commands and basic file manipulation. 

Before migrating data, you'll need to install Arches 4 and make a new project. You can name your project whatever you want, but throughout this documentation we'll refer to it as ``my_project``. You can customize the templates and images in your project any time (before or after migrating the data). We recommend adding a Mapbox key so you can use the map for visual checks during the migration.

.. seealso::

    Refer to :ref:`Installation` and :ref:`Projects and Packages`.

Before moving on, you should be able to run the Django devserver from your v4 project, and view it in a browser at http://localhost:8000.

Once you are ready, you can move on to exporting all of your legacy data from v3.

---------------------------
Exporting Your Data From v3
---------------------------

Before migrating to v4, you must export all of your data from v3. This will happen in parts, as described below. Before you begin, however, you'll need to install some enhanced commands into your v3 app. This is a simple process:

#. Download and unzip `arches3-export-utils <https://github.com/legiongis/arches3-export-utils/archive/master.zip>`_
#. Copy the "management" directory into your v3 app alongside the ``settings.py`` file.
#. Run ``python manage.py v3v4 --help`` to make sure the new commands have been been installed.

Now you are ready to begin exporting your data from v3. Follow these steps:

After you have all the v3 data exported, you are ready to follow the appropriate workflow for your deployment.

-------------------
Migrating Your Data
-------------------

The workflow you must use for the migration depends on the nature of your v3 deployment.

Arches-HIP App
--------------

If your v3 deployment of Arches was based on **Arches-HIP**, and you did not modify any of the graphs (beyond changing node names) you can use the Arches-HIP Workflow. If you have changed the RDM content, it will be preserved through the migration.

App With Custom Graphs
----------------------

If you have a v3 deployment with custom resource graphs, you'll need to use the following workflow. Be aware, you'll need to remake your custom resource graphs in v4 (as "Resource Models"). This is listed as Step 5 below.
