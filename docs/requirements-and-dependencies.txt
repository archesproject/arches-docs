System Requirements
===================

Arches works on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Most production implementations use Linux servers.

To begin development or make a test installation of Arches, you will need the following **minimum** resources:

:Disk Space: - **2GB** for all dependencies and Arches.
    - **8GB** to store uploaded files, database backups, etc.
    - Depending on how many uploaded files (images, 3d models, etc) you will have, you may need **much** more disk space. We advise an early evaulation of how much space you *think* you'll need, and then provision twice as much just to be safe...
:Memory (RAM):  - **4GB**
    - This recommendation is based on the fact that ElasticSearch requires 2GB to run, and as per `official ElasticSearch documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html#_give_less_than_half_your_memory_to_lucene>`_ no more than half of your system's memory should be dedicated to ElasticSearch.
    - In production, you may want to increase your memory, and allow ElasticSearch to use `up to 32GB <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html#compressed_oops>`_.

Software Dependencies
=====================

Full dependency installation on Ubuntu 18.04::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archesproject/arches/stable/7.0.0/arches/install/ubuntu_setup.sh>`_
    source ./ubuntu_setup.sh

To familiarize yourself with the components and learn some important details, please
read the notes below. Where necessary, OS-specific installation notes are included as well.

:Python 3.7: - Installation: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Python 3.7 and later comes with pip
    - **Windows** You must choose 32-bit or 64-bit Python based on your system architecture.
    - **macOS** This guide works well if you wish to install via `brew`: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/
:PostgreSQL >= 12 with PostGIS 3:
    - **macOS** Use `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com>`_.
    - **Windows** Use the `EnterpriseDB installers <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_, and use Stack Builder (included) to get PostGIS. After installation, add the following to your system's ``PATH`` environment variable: ``C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin``. Make sure you write down the password that you assign to the ``postgres`` user.
:Elasticsearch 7.4: - Installers: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-4-0
    - Elasticsearch is integral to Arches and can be installed and configured many ways.
      For more information, see :ref:`Arches and Elasticsearch`.
:GDAL >= 2.2.x: - **Windows** Use the `OSGeo4W installer <https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>`_, and choose to install the GDAL package (you don't need QGIS or GRASS). After installation, add ``C:\OSGeo4W64\bin`` to your system's ``PATH`` environment variable.
:Node.js 16.x (recommended): - Installation: https://nodejs.org/ (choose the installer appropriate to your operating system).
    - NOTE: Arches may not be compatible with later versions of Node.js (after 16) `(see discussion) <https://community.archesproject.org/t/newbie-v7-install-experience-some-hints-and-tips/1782>`_.
:Yarn >= 1.22, < 2: - Recommended Installation: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install (One can also install Yarn via `apt` on Linux operating systems, `see example <https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/f06b838cf1be23471644f8528a630d65c8bff9a7/arches/install/ubuntu_setup.sh#L51>`_).
    - NOTE: We are pointing to the "classic" yarn installer to avoid installation of more recent versions of yarn that are not compatible with Arches via the `Node.js` `package manager <https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install>`_.

To support long-running task management, like large user downloads, you must install a Celery broker like RabbitMQ or Redis:

:Brokers: - Options: https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html#choosing-a-broker
    - Once you have a broker installed, read more about :ref:`Task Management` in Arches.
