======================
Arches Querysets (App)
======================

**Arches Querysets** is an Arches modular application designed to simplify development of software interfacing with Arches managed data. Arches Querysets provides interfaces that closely align with `Django Querysets <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/querysets/>`_. Rather than interacting directly with the graph abstractions used in Arches, Arches Querysets enables developers to query Arches managed data using familiar and widely adopted conventions established by Django Querysets. Arches Querysets can be installed as a component of an Arches instance that runs on core Arches version 8 and higher.



Installing Arches Querysets
---------------------------
The **Arches Querysets** application needs to be installed in the Python virtual environment of your Arches instance. Once installed, you will need to edit your Arches instance's ``settings.py`` and other files. The complete installation instructions can be found here: `Arches Querysets README <https://github.com/archesproject/arches-querysets?tab=readme-ov-file#arches-querysets>`_
