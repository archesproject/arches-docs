Creating Applications
#####################

Starting with version 7.5, Arches adopted a new architectural pattern to support the need for implementors to easily share and maintain custom code. This new pattern, called **Arches Applications**, is similar to using "installed apps" in Django. It allows for easier development and maintenance of custom features by aligning with standard Django practices.


What's an Application?
======================
The term **Arches application** describes a Python package (usually pip installed) that provides some set of additional features beyond what core Arches provides. Arches application can be reused in multiple Arches projects.

Applications typically include some combination of models, views, templates, static files, URLs, etc. Theyâ€™re generally wired into Arches projects with the INSTALLED_APPS setting.

When are Arches Applications Useful?
====================================
Arches Applications are a means to power special purpose features that may not be appropriate for incorporation into the core (standard) Arches application. A given Arches Application can be under version control independent of core Arches. This should make it easier to update, upgrade, and maintain a custom Arches Application independently of Arches core.

Just like Arches itself, an Arches Application can also be developed, shared with the public, and be made open source. This means that the custom features powered by an Arches Application can be reused widely across the community. Because Arches Application development can proceed independently of core Arches, Arches Applications can be an excellent way for community members to experiment with features beyond those listed on the official Arches software development roadmap `official Arches software development roadmap <https://www.archesproject.org/roadmap/>`_.

`Arches for Science <https://www.archesproject.org/arches-for-science/>`_ illustrates the value of Arches Applications. Arches for Science has several workflows and features (together with additional software dependencies) useful for cultural heritage conservation science. However, these features would be unnecessary for many other core Arches use cases. Keeping these conservation science features in a distinct application allows `Arches for Science software development <https://github.com/archesproject/arches-for-science/>`_ to continue at its own pace, and it reduces pressures to add highly specialized features to core Arches. Arches Applications can therefore help reduce the complexity and maintenance costs of core Arches.


Arches Applications Can Help Avoid Forks
----------------------------------------
Arches Applications allow you to add special features to an Arches instance without forking the core Arches code. Avoiding forks has several benefits, including easier maintenance and the ability to apply upgrades and security patches provided by core Arches.```

A given Arches Application can also be developed and shared open source. This means that the custom features powered by an Arches Application can be reused across the community in multiple Arches projects.


Developing an Arches Application
------------------------------
While any given Arches Application can be reused in multiple Arches projects, one must first create an Arches project to host the Arches Application you seek to develop. You start with the following command to create a new Arches project to host your Arches Application:

.. code-block:: shell

        # Create a new Arches project for your Arches Application "example_app"
        arches-admin startproject example_app


Arches Applications will sometimes require specific versions of core Arches to function properly. Therefore, their maintenance and upgrade paths should be carefully considered. In addition, different Arches Applications may have different dependencies (including other Arches Applications), which can complicate future upgrades. Finally, Arches Applications may require additional testing to ensure that they are compatible with Arches Applications and with the core Arches software. In creating an Arches Application, you can specify version information and version expectations for core Arches in the ``settings.py`` file of your application.

.. code-block:: python

    APP_NAME = "example_app"
    APP_VERSION = semantic_version.Version(major=1, minor=0, patch=0)
    APP_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())))
    MIN_ARCHES_VERSION = semantic_version.Version(major=7, minor=5, patch=0)
    MAX_ARCHES_VERSION = semantic_version.Version(major=7, minor=6, patch=2)



Getting Started with an Example Arches Application
==================================================
The Arches team created a simple example Arches Application to illustrate how to develop and deploy custom applications. The example application called **Arches Dashboard** displays a summary count of resource instances and tiles in a given Arches project.

The **Arches Dashboard** app provides an example of how to build a custom Arches application. Experience with Arches in general, and Arches project development in particular, would be very useful for Arches Application development. 



Installing the **Arches Dashboard** Applications
------------------------------------------------
You can add the dashboard to an Arches project in just a few easy steps.

1. Install it from this repo (or clone this repo and pip install it locally):
    .. code-block:: shell

        pip install git+https://github.com/chiatt/dashboard.git


2. Add 'dashboard' to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting in the demo project's settings.py file, above your own project:
    .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # other applications already listed
            "dashboard",
            "demo",
        )


3. Add routing to your project to handle the Arches application. This can be either subdomain routing or path-based routing.
    - for subdomain routing:
        - Update your hosts.py file in your project:
            .. code-block:: python

                host_patterns = patterns('',
                    host(re.sub(r'_', r'-', r'dashboard'), 'dashboard.urls', name='dashboard'),
                    host(re.sub(r'_', r'-', r'demo'), 'demo.urls', name='demo'),
                )

   - for path-based routing:
        - Update your urls.py file in your project. You'll likely need to add the `re_path` import:
            .. code-block:: python

                from django.urls import include, path

        - and then the following path:
            .. code-block:: python

                path(r"^", include("dashboard.urls")),


4. From your project run migrate to add the model included in the app:
    .. code-block:: shell

        python manage.py migrate


5. Next be sure to rebuild your project's frontend to include the plugin:
    .. code-block:: shell

        npm run build_development


6. When you're done you should see the Dashboard plugin added to your main navigation bar:
