Arches Collector Checklist
##########################

.. warning::

    Arches Collector has been deprecated and **does not** function with Arches v7.x and higher. For
    more information about the deprecation of Arches Collector and future plans for mobile-apps,
    please refer to <https://community.archesproject.org/t/arches-collector-update/1580>.


The following steps must be completed to enable an Arches Collector connection
with your Arches instance.

Install CouchDB
---------------

.. note::

    Ubuntu 20 users must install CouchDB 2.x `with Docker <https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/docker.html>`_.

Arches uses CouchDB 2.x, though the current version of CouchDB is 3.x. If
you already have 3.x installed, use ``sudo apt-get --purge remove couchdb`` to start
over. Then:

.. code-block::

    # only if you haven't already done this
    wget --quiet -O - https://couchdb.apache.org/repo/bintray-pubkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apache.bintray.com/couchdb-deb $(lsb_release -sc) main"
    sudo apt-get update

    # necessary to find the older release
    sudo apt-cache policy couchdb
    sudo apt-get update

this will list all available versions â€” make note of the latest version 2
and then install it:

.. code-block::

    sudo apt-get install couchdb=2.3.1~bionic


.. important::

    It may be necessary to use this installation method instead:

    .. code-block::

        sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl apt-transport-https gnupg
        curl https://couchdb.apache.org/repo/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/couchdb-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null 2>&1
        source /etc/os-release
        echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/couchdb-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/couchdb-deb/ ${VERSION_CODENAME} main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/couchdb.list >/dev/null



For the quickest installation configuration, choose `standalone`, `127.0.0.1`, and pick
your password.

Test the installation with ``curl http://admin:[your password]@127.0.0.1:5984``,
the response should contain the correct version number.

Finally, add this line to ``settings.py`` or ``settings_local.py``:

.. code-block::

    COUCHDB_URL = 'http://admin:[your password]@127.0.0.1:5984'

At this point you should be ready to move on, but see the
`official CouchDB setup documentation <https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/setup/index.html>`_
for more information.

Register an OAuth Application
-----------------------------

To allow others to connect to your Arches instance, including Arches Collector users, you must create an OAuth client id and add it to your settings.

#. In a browser go to

    .. code-block:: none

        http://<yourdomain:port>/o/applications/

#. Create a new application
#. Fill out the form with a **Name** of your choosing, and set **Client type** and **Authorization grant type** as shown in the image below.

    .. image:: images/oauth-create-client.png

#. Copy the **Client id** and submit the form (you can access this id at any time).
#. In your Arches project's ``settings.py`` or ``settings_local.py`` file, set or add this variable

    .. code-block:: none

        MOBILE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = "<your new Client id>"

.. important::

    + Only make one application, though you are technically allowed to make more.
    + An application is "owned" by whichever user created it, and will not be visible to other users.

Set WSGIPassAuthorization in Apache Conf
----------------------------------------

If you are using Apache as a webserver, you must add the following line to your VirtualHost:

.. code-block::

    WSGIPassAuthorization on

Restart Apache for all of these steps to take effect. You should now be able to
use the :ref:`Arches Collector Manager` to create new projects.

Configure a Celery Broker
-------------------------

To support sync operations between the mobile app and your Arches database,
Celery must be supplied with a message broker. Please see :ref:`Task Management`
for how to set this up.
