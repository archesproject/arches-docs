Next Steps: Using Arches
========================

Now that you’ve installed and configured Arches, you can start building
your inventory of cultural heritage. A few things that you’ll probably
want to consider:

Backup Your Arches Database
---------------------------

Arches uses the PostgreSQL/PostGIS relational database. You can download
an application called PGAdmin (http://www.pgadmin.org/) to ease many of
the basic Arches databasem management tasks.

PGAdmin has a clean and easy-to-understand user interface, and it will
make database backups easy. But be forwarned! PGAdmin will also allow
you to work with every aspect of the Arches data model, so tread
carefully!

Performance Tuning
------------------

Arches doesn’t attempt to tune any of the many performance variables
that PostgreSQL exposes. But, based on the size and complexity of your
dataset, you may want to re-allocate system resources to PostgreSQL.

People have written entire books on how to squeeze the best performance
out of data management systems. Read-up on the basics before you attempt
to optimize your system!
