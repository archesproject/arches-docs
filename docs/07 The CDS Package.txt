The Core Data Standard (CDS) Package
====================================

The Arches community has developed the CDS Package v1.0 as an initial
data management module for Arches Server v2.0.0. The CDS Package
demonstrates the structure and contents of an Arches Package, and
implements the following standards:

-  CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)
   (`www.cidoc-crm.org <http://www.cidoc-crm.org>`__). The CRM provides
   definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and
   explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage
   documentation.
-  International Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural
   Heritage. This is a soon-to-be finalized standard for the inventory
   of both archaeological and architectural heritage, which is based on
   the earlier Core Data Index to Historic Buildings and Monuments of
   the Architectural Heritage (adopted by the Council of Europe in 1992)
   and the Core Data Standard for Archaeological Sites and Monuments
   (adopted by CIDOC in 1995). The new standard under preparation
   (referred to here as the "CDS") was used to identify the data fields
   of the CDS. Organizations that deploy the CDS can customize those
   data fields to meet their specific requirements.

You may wish to familiarize yourself with these data standards as part
of your the CDS installation and deployment effort. If you ever wish to
further customize the CDS, familiarity with both will help you greatly
along the way.

Some of the key contents of the CDS Package include:

-  Resource Graphs
-  Authority Documents and Thesauri
-  Data Import Files

The following sections summarize these components of an Arches Package.

Resource Graphs
---------------

Arches is designed to manage cultural heritage data anywhere in the
world. Needless to say, that's an ambitious goal. After all,
architecture considered culturally significant in San Francisco - a city
founded in 1776 - might not merit much comment in Cairo or London.

So, how does Arches resolve this?

Arches Server requires a set of Resource Graphs that define the set of
resource types that you wish to include in your inventory and the terms
that you will use to describe them.

.. note::

  **What is an Arches Resource Graph?**

  In Arches, the term
  "Resource Graph" refers to a class of cultural heritage records. Things
  like "Architectural Heritage", "Investigation Activity", and "Person"
  are all examples of Resource Graphs. Think of a Resource Graph as
  defining the attributes for a particular category of information that
  Arches will manage. 

  A Resource is simply one instance of a particular Resource Graph.

Resource Graphs are described following the CIDOC Conceptual Reference
Model (CRM). The CRM is an ontology for cultural heritage information
that has been developed by a the International Committee for
Documentation (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museums. Arches
uses the CRM because it was adopted by the International Organization
for Standardization as the standard (ISO 21127:2006) for the interchange
of cultural heritage information.

CDS Package Resource Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CDS Package defines the following Resource Graphs:

::

        ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (ARTIFACT).E18
        ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (SITE).E27
        ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18
        LANDSCAPE HERITAGE.E27
        MARITIME HERITAGE.E18
        INVESTIGATION.E7
        MANAGEMENT.E7
        DESIGNATION AND PROTECTION.E7
        HISTORICAL EVENT.E5
        DOCUMENT.E31
        IMAGE.E38
        PERSON.E21
        ORGANIZATION.E74

**Heritage Resources:**
Heritage Resources are archaeological, built, landscape, or other
immovable cultural heritage. In the CDS, Heritage Resources include:

Archaeological Heritage (element) : a single archaeological entity that
could stand alone or be an element of a larger archaeological group
(e.g., a bath house within a Roman villa)

Archaeological Heritage (site) : an area of archaeological potential or
an area of known or discovered archaeological elements

.. note:: 

  **What's the difference between archaeological elements and sites?**
  
  While conceptually these categories overlap, the CDS differentiates
  between the two because of the way that they are represented using the
  CIDOC CRM.

Architectural Heritage : culturally significant buildings, structures,
and groups thereof

Landscape Heritage : areas of land designed and created intentionally by
man, such as garden and parkland landscapes constructed for aesthetic
reasons, organically evolved areas of land resulting from an initial
social, economic, administrative, and/or religious imperative and that
has developed its present form by association with and in response to
its natural environment, or areas of land that are culturally
significant due to powerful religious, artistic or cultural associations
of the natural element rather than material cultural evidence, which may
be insignificant or even absent (UNESCO)

Maritime Heritage : underwater heritage (both under sea and inland),
which may include heritage inundated by sea level rise and dam
construction, shipwrecks and aircraft, as well as heritage afloat (e.g.,
ships, sailing vessels)

**Activities** Activities are events or actions that may take place
during a given time span and at a location or area. In the CDS,
Activities include:

Investigation Activity : an activity undertaken with the explicit
intention of gathering information about, and understanding of, a
Heritage Resource, and the creation of an information source to record
that information and understanding

Management Activity : an activity undertaken to prevent damage to,
promote the survival of, and promote the understanding and appreciation
of Heritage Resources.

Designation and Protection Activity : an activity which implements or
revokes statutory and non-statutory designation and protection regimes
which may apply to Heritage Resources

Historical Event : any activity that took place in the past, including
both human and natural events

**Documents** Documents are information carriers such as books, texts,
periodicals, inscriptions, audio files, video files, 3-D models, or
images. In the CDS, Documents include:

Document : an information carrier, other than an Image, whether physical
or digital, eg. books, maps, pdfs, word-processed documents

Image : an information carrier that represent an external form, whether
physical or digital, eg. photographs, slides, drawings, jpegs or tiff
files.

**Actors**
Actors refer to individuals or groups of people. In the CDS, Actors
include:

Person : real persons (i.e., who live or are assumed to have lived)

Organization : A group or legally identifiable body

Authority Documents
-------------------

Like any good data-editing tool, Arches supports consistent and valid
data entry. Almost every one is familiar with this concept: it's the
ability to select a valid value from a list:

.. figure:: images/Dropdown.png
   :alt: Selecting a value from a "Controlled Vocabulary"

   Selecting a value from a "Controlled Vocabulary"

Notice that in this Arches data entry form, you're able to select the
kind of Archaeological Heritage Element from among the list of approved
types or classifications. In Arches, these lists are called "controlled
vocabularies".

But what if you want to use a particular list of period names, instead
of the names that come with Arches? Arches allows you to define exactly
the set of names you want to use for every resource.

Thesauri
~~~~~~~~

So, why do we use the term "controlled vocabulary" if all we're doing is
selecting values from a drop-down list? The answer is that Arches treats
each drop-down list as if it's a thesaurus.

And what's so special about thesauri? They provide a potent way organize
concepts and a convenient way to attach labels to concepts. This makes
data entry and searching a large database for specific resources much
easier.

Lets say we want to create a list of dwellings where people live as a
drop-down list in Arches. Our list might look like this:

::

        dwelling
          apartment
          house
          hut
          log cabin
        

The thesaurus allows you to define concepts and give them labels. For
example, "dwelling" is the label associated with the concept of "a place
where people live."

Note also that each concept under "dwelling" is a more precise (or
narrower) type of dwelling. In this example, there are four additional
narrower concepts of dwelling. One such concept (eg.: a place where
families live) has the term "house" associated with it.

This ability to build hierarchies of concepts makes thesauri very
powerful. We can use the structure of a thesaurus to help make clear the
relationships between concepts.

But wait just a moment. We know that in some areas, people use different
terms to mean the same thing. A thesaurus allows us to attach many
labels to the same concept. For example:

::

        dwellings
          apartment
          house [aisled house, bungalow, chalet]
          hut
          log cabin

This is a representation that adds more, alternate labels for the
concept "house". In this example, the labels "aisled house," "bungalow,"
and "chalet" all represent alternate labels for the same concept. Note
that we could add "Haus" and "maison" if we wanted to include labels for
the same concept in additional languages such as German or French.

It's up to you to decide how you want to organize your terms. Is a
"chalet" really an alternate label for house, or should it be considered
a narrower concept of dwelling?

At this point you may be wondering why we've made a simple drop-down
list so complicated.

Well, by using thesauri to power the drop-down lists, Arches will know
that when you search for a resource using the term "chalet" you really
mean "house". And if you search for a resource using the term
"dwelling", you'll get all the narrower concepts for dwelling, even if
you didn't know that a "hut" a "dwelling".

Understanding the Structure of an Authority Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's look at an authority document in more detail:

::

    ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT
        

This authority document holds the list of Architectural Heritage types
that the CDS will use. Types are just what you'd guess: a list of the
kinds of Architectural Heritage that you will allow people to choose
from when they enter a new Architectural Heritage resource into Arches.

Your ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE Authority Document can contain any
entries that you think are appropriate. Here are some examples:

::

    Air Raid Siren
    Church
    House
    Chalet
    Fountain
    Street Lamp
                

Adding these concepts to Arches would require you to update the
Architectural Heritage authority document. The good news is that all
Arches authority files are simple text files with the following 5
columns:

ConceptID: 
  a unique identifier for the concept

PrefLabel: 
  the default label that you wish to use for this concept

AltLabels: 
  alternative ways to identify the concept

Parent ConceptID: 
  the unique identifier of a broader concept (this will construct hierarchies)

Provider: 
  identifies the source of the concept

Building an authority document is just a matter of adding a row for
every concept that you want to include in your drop down lists. In our
example, the authority document might look like this:

  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+
  | ConceptID   | PrefLabel        | AltLabels          | Parent ConceptID   | Provider   |
  +=============+==================+====================+====================+============+
  |  1          | Air Raid Siren   |                    |                    | EH         |
  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+
  |  2          | Church           | House of Worship   |                    | EH         |
  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+
  |  3          | House            |                    |                    | EH         |
  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+
  |  4          | Chalet           |                    | 3                  | EH         |
  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+
  |  5          | Fountain         | fount;jet;spout    |                    | EH         |
  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+
  |  6          | Street Lamp      |                    |                    | EH         |
  +-------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------+

Notice that in one line, we can add a concept, define its preferred
label, optionally provide alternate labels, and define broader/narrower
relationships between concepts.

There are a few things to be aware of:

.. warning::

  **ConceptIDs must be unique!**

  Make sure that you use a truly unique
  identifier for each record that you want to load into Arches.

.. note::

  Use a semicolon to separate more than one Alternate Label
  
  Commas are used to separate columns, so we need a different way to indicate all
  the different alternate labels for a concept 


.. note::

  **Narrower Terms**

  Use the ConceptID of the broader term in the
  "Parent ConceptID" field if you want to tell Arches that concepts are
  related. Arches will use this information to make searching the
  inventory better and more intuitive.

.. note::

  **Required Terms**

  Arches has only one required term: The term "Primary" is required to
  appear in NAME TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT. Why? Because Arches supports
  multiple names for any resource, it needs a way to define the preferred
  name for a resource.

Understanding Authority Document Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might have noticed that a few Authority Documents seem to come in
pairs. For example:

::

    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv
    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv

What's going on here? Sometimes its convenient to know a bit more about
some of the concepts in a thesaurus than just a set of labels and its
parent. For example, when discussing specific cultural periods (such as
"Middle Paleolithic"), it's often useful to reference the start and end
years of the period.

Arches "values" files let us do this. Open CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT.values.csv and you'll see the following:

.. figure:: images/Periods_Values.png
   :alt: Cultural Period Values

   Cultural Period Values

Note the first row in this file: **conceptid**, **Value**, **Value
Type**, **Provider**

These headers define a simple structure of the value file. You simply
have to reference a conceptID from the CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT.csv file, provide the value and its "type", and the provider of
the value.

For cultural periods, the values file allows you to attach the start
year and end year for each Period concept in the CULTURAL PERIOD
AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv file. Look at lines 7 and 9 in the image above
and you will see:

::

    7  PERIOD_UID:55, -150000, minimum date, EH  
    9  PERIOD_UID:55, -40000, maximum date, EH  

If you look up "PERIOD\_UID:55" in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT.csv, you'll see that it's record is:

::

    PERIOD_UID:55,MIDDLE PALAEOLITHIC,,PERIOD_UID:5,EH

So, in the CDS pacakge, the default list of Cultural Periods includes
the Middle Palaeolithic (as "PERIOD\_UID:55" in CULTURAL PERIOD
AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv), and that period is defined to start at -150,000
years (row 7 in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv) and end
at -40,000 years (row 9 in the same file).

What Value Types Can I Define?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define any set of key/value pairs that you wish. Arches will
load your values and associate them with the concept identifier that you
provide.

By default, Arches defines values for the following Authority Document
value files:

::

    ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv  
    ARCHES RESOURCE CROSS-REFERENCE RELATIONSHIP TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv  
    CONDITION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv  
    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv  
    TYPE OF DESIGNATION OR PROTECTION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv  
    UNIT OF MEASUREMENT AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv  

If you look at these files, you'll see that Arches already knows how to
handle the following value types:

**SortOrder**
You can use the \*.values.csv file to define the order in which terms
appear for:

::

    UNIT OF MEASUREMENT AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv
    TYPE OF DESIGNATION OR PROTECTION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv
    CONDITION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv

**Minimum Date, Maximum Date**
You can use the \*.values.csv file to define the starting and ending
dates for:

::

    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.values.csv

**Geometry, Administrative Area Type**
You can use the ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT.values.csv file to define administrative subdivision types and
the geometry associated with each administrative area. For example:

::

    LOC_UID:97317,PARISH,admin area type filter,EH

would define the concept LOC\_UID:97317 (in the ADMINISTRATIVE
SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv file) as an "admin area type filter"
with a value of "PARISH". And

::

    LOC_UID:97345,"POLYGON((-1.32078640715254 54.3728610449506,-1.33713112471483 54.3586411276027,-1.3584180849332 54.371070777731,-1.34399265906457 54.376710180739,-1.32078640715254 54.3728610449506))",geometry,EH

would define the concept LOC\_UID:97345 (in the ADMINISTRATIVE
SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.csv file) as having a geometry with a set
of particular coordinates that make up a polygon.

**Resource Cross-Reference, Cross-Reference Type Filter** Arches allows
you to build relationships between resources. For example, you can
relate a Person resource to an Architectural Heritage resource. Arches
implements an Authority File that allows you to define the types
relationships between resources.

::

    ARCHES RESOURCE CROSS-REFERENCE RELATIONSHIP TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT

**Custom Key/Values Pairs**
Arches will allow you to load any set of key/value pairs, treating the
information that you load as descriptive data about the concept.

If you want to use your key/value pairs to support data entry (like the
from/to dates for Cultural Periods), you may need to extend the Arches
codebase he codebase to use your key/value pairs.

Modifying the Default Authority Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CDS package comes with a set of concepts and labels for each
controlled vocabulary. Of course, you are welcome to use the package
defaults but you'll probably want to use your own concepts and terms.

To modify the default authority files, just open an authority document
with a text editor and begin. You can remove records from a file, or add
new records that better represent the concepts, labels, and
concept-relationships that you use to describe cultural heritage.

.. note::

  **Back up the original Authority Documents First!**

  It's a good idea
  to make copies of the original files, just in case you want to go back
  and confirm that your edits make sense.

.. note::

  **Don't Forget about the "values" Files!**

  If you change an
  Authority Document that has an associated values file, you'll want to
  make sure that the conceptIDs match between the Authority Document and
  the corresponding value file. By the way, Arches will work without any
  "values" files. They're just a convenient way to augment Authority
  Documents.

.. note::

  **Geometry in Authority Files** 

  Sometimes the additional "values"
  that you want to associate to concepts within an authority file are
  geometries that can be represented on the map or used for spatial
  analysis. For example, if you have a controlled list of states or
  provinces, you may wish to assocaite the relevant geometry to describe
  its borders.

You can use the \*.values file to pass in a geometry associated to a
concept using a text-based format called Well Known Text (or WKT for
short.) See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text for a good
description of WKT. Arches assumes that all WKT passed into the system
is in Lat/Lon coordinates using WSG84 datum (also known as EPSG 4326
http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/).

The CDS includes 13 Resource Types grouped into four categories. And
each resource has a set of attributes associated with it. The CDS comes
with a default set of controlled vocabularies and automatically matches
each vocabulary with the appropriate resource attribute.

In Arches the term "Authority Documents" is used to denote the files
that hold the concepts, preferred label, alternate labels, and parent
concept (to support hierarchies of concepts) for each drop-down list.
Some Authority Documents are common to all Resource Types, while others
are particular to specific categories of Resource Types. Here is a list
of all of them:

**Authority Documents common to all Resource Types:**

You can find all the Authority Documents in the following folder:

::

     source_data/concepts/authority_files

.. note::

  **What's up with all the ".E Numbers"?** 

  Resource Types, attributes,
  and all other entities in the CDS are instances of CIDOC CRM classes.
  The CRM uses a "E.xx" naming style to define its classes, so we append
  the CRM class identifier to our CDS entities so that its clear what each
  CDS entity actually represents.

Data Import Files
-----------------

As you've seen, the CDS package comes with the following 13 Resource
Types:

-  Heritage Resources

   -  Archaeological Heritage (element)

   -  Archaeological Heritage (site)

   -  Architectural Heritage

   -  Landscape Heritage

   -  Maritime Heritage

-  Activities

   -  Investigation activity

   -  Management activity

   -  Designation and protection activity

   -  Historical event

-  Documents

   -  Document

   -  Image

-  Actors

   -  Person

   -  Organization

Each of these Resource Types has a set of attributes. Attributes are
really just pieces of information about each resource. For example, one
of the Attributes of the Archaeological Heritage (Element) resource is
its cultural period. In the Arches user interface, Attributes are
organized into Information Themes. See the companion **Arches User
Guide** for more information on the user interface.

Some attributes are common to many Resource Types. "Name" is a good
example, which is common to all Resource Types. Every resource can have
a name associated with it. Most Resource Types have quite a few
attributes.

.. note::

  **Why do I need to know about attributes?**

  If you already have heritage data in a database or spreadsheet, you
  can build a file that will let you import your data into Arches. And to
  do this, you need to know exactly which attributes each resource has.

To see exactly which attributes are associated with a resource, open the
this file within the CDS repo:

::

    source_data/resource_graphs/CDS attributes.csv

Here are the first few records of CDS attributes.csv:

.. figure:: images/Resource_Attributes.png
   :alt: Resources Attributes.txt

   Resources Attributes.txt

Each line in this file simply states that an Arches resource has an
attribute that is associated with it. Notice the three columns:

**ResourceType**: The Arches Resource Type of the Resource
**AttributeName**: The attribute associated with the Resource Type
**AuthorityDocument**: If this column is populated, then the attribute
value must be a unique identifier found in the authority file that is
named in this column.

You can think of the Resource Attributes.txt file as a listing of the
set of data that you can load into Arches.

.. note::

  **What's up with all the ".E Numbers"?** 
  
  Resources, attributes, and
  all other entities in Arches are instances of CIDOC CRM classes. The CRM
  uses a "E.xx" naming style to define its classes, so we append the CRM
  class identifier to our Arches entities so that its clear what each
  Arches entity actually represents.

Creating a Data Import File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CDS comes with a file that you can use to load information into
Arches. The is located at:

::

    source_data/resource_info.csv

The package reads the content of resource\_info.csv and loads it into a
database. If you open this file from the CDS package, you'll see that it
already contains data for a set of heritage resources. You'll need to
replace the information in this file with your own data if you want to
automatically populate Arches with data.

By the way, don't let the file name fool you, "resource\_info.csv" is a
\| delimited file (a "pipe" delimited file) that illustrates the
structure of a valid Arches import file.

.. note::

  **Why use a "\|" instead of commas?**

  The Arches import file allows
  you to include text blocks (so that you can import free text). Text
  often includes commas, but rarely includes a \|. So we use the \|
  character to distinguish columns in the resource\_info.csv file.

Here are some representative records from a load file:

.. figure:: images/Resource_Load.png
   :alt: Resource\_Info.csv

   Resource\_Info.csv

And here's how to understand what's going on: Each line in the file
defines a resource and an attribute to load into Arches. Each of the
column headers **RESOURCEID**, **RESOURCETYPE**, **ATTRIBUTENAME**,
**ATTRIBUTEVALUE**, and **GROUPID** define the content of the file. Most
are self-explanatory, with the exception of the "GROUPID" field (which
we'll look at in more detail later).

Let's look at line 1:

::

    15897|ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18|COMPILER.E82|ROD FITZGERALD|COMPILER.E82-0

This record tells Arches that:

-  We're going to load information about an "ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18"
   resource (**RESOURCETYPE**)
-  Our resource can be uniquely identified by the string "15897"
   (**RESOURCEID**)
-  We're going to load a value for the "COMPILER.E82" attribute
   (**ATTRIBUTENAME**)
-  The value of the Compiler.E82 attribute is "ROD FITZGERALD"
   (**ATTRIBUTEVALUE**)
-  This record is part of a group of records identified as
   "COMPILER.E82-0" (**GROUPID**)

Notice that we can import lots of information about a single resource
simply by referencing the same **RESOURCEID** and **RESOURCETYPE**.

Adding Multiple Values to an Attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why all this formalism and complexity?

Because many cultural heritage objects have more than value for a given
attribute. For example, a single resource can often have many names. Or
the characteristics of a resource may change over time. Without allowing
for multiple values for an attribute, Arches wouldn't be able to track
the evolution of a resource.

So, the Arches data import file structure is important because many
resource attributes may have multiple values. Indeed, an Architectural
Heritage resource may be associated with several cultural periods, have
many addresses, and have several protection grades.

That's why Arches allows you load many attribute values for a single
resource attribute.

Notice in the file shown that we can add several compilers into Arches
for the same resource. In fact, lines 3, 4, and 5 also define
compilation records. In general, Arches will allow you to add multiple
values for a given attribute.

.. note::

  **Single Attributes** 

  At present, Arches' user interface can show
  multiple values for all entities except for the Summary Description,
  Distinguishing Features, and Location Description entities.

Attribute Goups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now look at lines 8 through 11 in the example file.

Individually, each row assigns a value for a specific attribute. The
FROM DATE.E49 and TO DATE.E49 attributes are years. Line 8 seems to be
describing a Cultural Period, and Line 10 the Architectural Resource
type.

But notice that each record in rows 8 through 11 all share the same
"PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0" **GROUPID**. This means that these 4
records together describe a resource.

By grouping these rows together with the same **GROUPID**, you can tell
Arches that these 4 records are not independent; rather together they
describe the resource.

Here's how to interpret what's going on. Each of the records starts
with:

::

    15897|ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18

This means that each record contains information about the Architectural
Heritage.E18 Resource with the unique identifier of 15897. Okay, let's
focus on what comes next:

::

     8  CULTURAL PERIOD.E55|PERIOD_UID:28|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0
     9  FROM DATE.E49|1066|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0
    10  ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE.E55|AH:THE_TE_UID:68841|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0
    11  TO DATE.E49|1540|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0

Look at line 8. Its **ATTRIBUTENAME** is "CULTURAL PERIOD.E55", and the
value of this attribute is "PERIOD\_UID:28". Recall from the Chapter
"Step 3: Load Controlled Vocabularies" that we use an Authority Document
for Cultural Periods. So, the **ATTRIBUTEVALUE** "PERIOD\_UID:28" in
line 8 is a pointer to a concept in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT.csv (which works out to "Medieval").

OK, now look at line 9. Its **ATTRIBUTENAME** is "FROM DATE.E49" and its
**ATTRIBUTEVALUE** is "1066". Simple enough: "from date" is the year
1066.

Line 10 tells Arches to use the unique identifier
"AH:THE\_TE\_UID:68841" in ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT.csv to define the value for "ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE.E55"
(a "Motte"), and line 11 says that the resource has a "TO DATE.E49"
value of "1540".

And here's the payoff: by giving these 4 records the same **GROUPID**,
we are telling Arches that:

    "The ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18 resource with unique identifier of
    "15897" was a "Motte" during the "Medieval" cultural period,
    specifically between the years 1066 and 1540."

Recall that Arches will support many combinations of cultural period,
heritage type, and from/to dates for a single resource.

Now, we can understand that the purpose of the **GROUPID** is to allow
for grouping a set of related attributes into a coherent record.

The actual values that you use for **GROUPID** are arbitrary, just make
sure that you use a unique value for each set of attributes that you
want to group.

One last note on **GROUPID** and resource\_info: notice that in this
resource\_info file records with the same **GROUPID** are grouped
together(located on adjacent lines). This grouping within the
resource\_info file is necessary to ensure your grouped attributes are
not duplicated upon import into Arches.

.. note::

  **Required Data**

  By design, Arches can accommodate a wide variety of data. The only
  real data requirement is this: **If you want to name a resource, you
  must provide one name with a NAME TYPE.E55 of "Primary."** Because you
  can give a resource as many names as you want, Arches uses the "Primary"
  designation to identify the preferred name of the resource.

Which Attributes can be Grouped?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all attributes can (or should) be grouped together. Based on the
*Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage*
(introduced in the "Deploying Arches" chapter), Arches allows for the
following attributes to be grouped:

-  **NAME.E41** and **NAME TYPE.E55**
-  **SPATIAL COORDINATES\_GEOMETRY.E47** and **SPATIAL COORDINATES
   QUALIFIER**
-  Any combination of attributes starting with **ADRESS\_**
-  Any combination of **PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT**, **FROM DATE.E49**,
   **TO DATE.E49**, and **HERITAGE RESOURCE TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT**
   (e.g.: Archaeological Heritage (Element), Archaeological Heritage
   (Site), Architectural Heritage, Landscape Heritage, Maritime
   Heritgae)

Loading Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loading data into Arches requires three things. Those are:

1. Validly Structured and Populated Resource Graphs

   for defining the resources, their attributes, and how they are
   related to each other

2. Validly Structured Authority Files and ENTITY\_TYPE\_X\_ADOC file

   for defining the values that can be associated with attributes
   constrained by controlled vocbularies

3. A resource\_info.csv file with content that adheres to the
   constraints imposed by the resource graphs and the authority files.

   resource\_info contains the business data that is to be imported to
   the Arches database.

Once you've prepared your data load file, you may insert its contents
into Arches. Be sure to confirm that you are referencing your Authority
Documents properly (e.g.: the unique ID you use in your load file should
also exist in the appropriate Authority Document).

Arches will load and index each of the cultural heritage data records
that you've defined in your data file. Don't worry if it takes a few
attempts to get your data to load cleanly. You can always re-run the
Arches build scripts to get a pristine instance of Arches.
